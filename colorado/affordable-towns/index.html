                <h1>Priced Out of Denver? 15 Colorado Towns Where You Can Actually Afford a House</h1>
            </header>

            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Denver's median home price is pushing $600k. The suburbs aren't much better. But Colorado is a big state—and there are still places where you can buy a decent house for under $300k.</p>

                <p>Here are 15 towns where housing is still affordable in 2025, organized by region.</p>

                <figure class="article-image">
                    <img src="https://denversam.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Crested-Butte-in-the-fall.jpg" alt="Crested Butte in the fall" loading="lazy">
                </figure>

                <h2 id="southeast-plains">The Southeast: Where Your Money Goes Furthest</h2>

                <p>The southeastern corner of Colorado doesn't get much love, but it's hands-down the cheapest part of the state. We're talking wide-open plains, small farming communities, and home prices that'll make Front Range residents weep with envy. The trade-off? You're pretty far from the mountains, and these towns are quiet—like, really quiet.</p>

                <h3 id="la-junta">La Junta: The Absolute Cheapest ($162k)</h3>

                <p><strong>Population:</strong> 7,033 | <strong>County:</strong> Otero | <strong>Median home price:</strong> $162,000<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/VzCdJ4G8XCx96uGv7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View La Junta on Google Maps</a></p>

                <p>If you want the absolute cheapest housing in Colorado, La Junta is your answer. This tiny farming town sits about 60 miles east of Pueblo, and it's best known for its sweet melons and connection to the Santa Fe Trail. You'll find Bent's Old Fort National Monument nearby if you're into history.</p>

                <p>The local economy runs on farming, healthcare, and a few retirement communities. There's a small airport and a downtown business district with the basics. It's not flashy, but if you're looking to buy a house for the price of a used car in Boulder, this is the spot.</p>

                <div class="instagram-embed-container">
                    <blockquote class="instagram-media" style="width:100%; max-width:100%;" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNVkdZJuavX/" data-instgrm-version="14"></blockquote>
                </div>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Retirees, remote workers, people who genuinely like small-town life</li>
                    <li><strong>Skip if:</strong> You need mountains, nightlife, or anything resembling a city</li>
                    <li><strong>Real talk:</strong> This is rural Colorado—you'll drive for groceries</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="lamar">Lamar: Bird Watching &amp; Community Vibes ($215k)</h3>

                <p><strong>Population:</strong> 7,375 | <strong>County:</strong> Prowers | <strong>Median home price:</strong> $215,000<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hNBpdSBkqX5YjJ8D9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View Lamar on Google Maps</a></p>

                <p>Lamar sits even further east than La Junta, but it has a surprising draw: the annual snow geese migration brings thousands of birders every year. The town has decent parks, access to John Martin Reservoir State Park, and a genuinely strong sense of community.</p>

                <p>Healthcare and agriculture dominate the job market here. You're definitely trading mountain views for prairie sunsets, but if you want affordable family living and don't mind being off the beaten path, Lamar delivers.</p>

                </div>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Must-see:</strong> Snow geese migration in spring (it's actually incredible)</li>
                    <li><strong>Jobs:</strong> Healthcare, farming, some retail</li>
                    <li><strong>Distance to Denver:</strong> About 3 hours—not a day trip</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="trinidad">Trinidad: The Art Scene Surprise ($237.5k)</h3>

                <p><strong>Population:</strong> 8,134 | <strong>County:</strong> Las Animas | <strong>Median home price:</strong> $237,500<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/NpFy8pwHQ41FTCau5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View Trinidad on Google Maps</a></p>

                <p>Trinidad sits right on the New Mexico border, and it's got something the other southeast towns don't: a legitimate art scene and entrepreneurial energy. The historic downtown has actual galleries, restaurants, and shops that aren't just surviving—they're thriving.</p>

                <p>You've got two state parks nearby (Trinidad Lake and Fishers Peak), so outdoor recreation is covered. Young professionals are starting to discover Trinidad, which means prices will probably climb, but right now it's still affordable. If you want small-town Colorado with a creative community, this might be your spot.</p>

                <div class="instagram-embed-container">

                </div>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rising market alert:</strong> Prices are going up as artists and remote workers move in</li>
                    <li><strong>Outdoor access:</strong> Two state parks within 30 minutes</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural bonus:</strong> Actual restaurants and galleries downtown</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="northeast-plains">The Northeast Plains: Farms, Wind &amp; Affordability</h2>

                <p>Colorado's northeastern plains are all about agriculture, wide-open spaces, and some of the best bird watching in the state. These towns won't win beauty contests, but they offer solid community living without the price tag.</p>

                <h3 id="sterling">Sterling: The Biggest Town Out East ($211.5k)</h3>

                <p><strong>Population:</strong> 12,714 | <strong>County:</strong> Logan | <strong>Median home price:</strong> $211,500<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/2HgDuErCCfsXKAe16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View Sterling on Google Maps</a></p>

                <p>Sterling is the most populated city east of Pueblo, which means it actually has infrastructure: a regional airport, a junior college, good schools, and local parks. It's a farm and ranch community through and through, but families genuinely like it here.</p>

                <p>If you're raising kids and want affordable housing with actual amenities (not just a gas station and a Dollar General), Sterling is worth considering. You get hiking, golfing, and a real sense of Western culture.</p>

                    <li><strong>Job market:</strong> Agriculture-dominated, some retail and services</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="fort-morgan">Fort Morgan: History &amp; Green Spaces ($295.9k)</h3>

                <p><strong>Population:</strong> 11,756 | <strong>County:</strong> Morgan | <strong>Median home price:</strong> $295,900<br>

                <p>Fort Morgan sits 82 miles northeast of Denver—close enough to make occasional trips to the city, far enough to escape the crazy housing prices. The town has a historic downtown, tons of green spaces, and hosts the Glen Miller SwingFest every year (honoring the legendary musician who was born here).</p>

                <p>Jobs come from agriculture processing: there's a Cargill meatpacking plant, a Leprino Foods cheese factory, and a large Dairy Farmers of America facility. It's industrial, but it's work.</p>

                    <li><strong>Big employers:</strong> Cargill, Leprino Foods, agricultural operations</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural draw:</strong> Glen Miller SwingFest and vibrant music scene</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="san-luis-valley">The Mystic San Luis Valley: Weird, Beautiful &amp; Cheap</h2>

                <p>The San Luis Valley is one of Colorado's most unique regions—it's the largest alpine valley in the world, home to the Great Sand Dunes, and honestly just weird in the best way. You've got an alligator farm, a UFO watchtower, and some of the poorest counties in the state. It's beautiful, isolated, and definitely not for everyone.</p>

                <h3 id="walsenburg">Walsenburg: Coal Town Turned Cannabis Hub ($186k)</h3>

                <p><strong>Population:</strong> 3,022 | <strong>County:</strong> Huerfano | <strong>Median home price:</strong> $186,000<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/JF8YMJJEeKMuW1pL9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View Walsenburg on Google Maps</a></p>

                <p>Walsenburg sits on the edge of the San Luis Valley in what's called the Spanish Peaks Region. This town was built on coal, and while that industry has shrunk, Walsenburg is now betting big on cannabis. Cheap rent and a marijuana-friendly business environment have attracted entrepreneurs.</p>

                <p>The downtown is charming, and there's a growing art scene thanks to the Museum of Friends. Fair warning: Huerfano County is the poorest in Colorado, so economic opportunities are limited. But if you're okay with a quiet, artsy, small-town vibe and want the cheapest mountain-adjacent living you can find, this is it.</p>

                    <li><strong>Real talk:</strong> Limited jobs outside of tourism and cannabis</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="alamosa">Alamosa: Gateway to the Sand Dunes ($285k)</h3>

                <p>Alamosa is the biggest city in the San Luis Valley and the base camp for visiting Great Sand Dunes National Park. Downtown has shops, restaurants, museums, and Adams State University brings in students and track athletes (the elevation makes it perfect for training).</p>

                <p>You're in a great spot for outdoor activities: hiking, biking, skiing at Wolf Creek, and the Cumbres &amp; Toltec Railroad draws thousands of tourists annually. The local economy runs on farming (potatoes and hops), tourism, and education.</p>

                <h2 id="pikes-peak-region">Pikes Peak Region: Bigger Cities, More Jobs</h2>

                <p>The Pikes Peak region includes Colorado Springs and Pueblo—the state's second and third largest metro areas. These cities have actual economies, infrastructure, and things to do. They're pricier than the plains, but still way cheaper than Denver.</p>

                <h3 id="pueblo">Pueblo: Steel City Revival ($265k)</h3>

                <p><strong>Population:</strong> 110,397 | <strong>County:</strong> Pueblo | <strong>Median home price:</strong> $265,000<br>

                <p>Pueblo sits just under two hours south of Denver, and it's seeing a surge of Front Range refugees who can't afford Denver anymore. The town is deeply rooted in Hispanic culture, hosts the Colorado State Fair, and has a revitalized riverwalk that's actually pretty nice.</p>

                <p>The steel industry is still alive here with Evraz Rocky Mountain Steel, and agriculture is huge—Pueblo is known for melons, vegetables, and those famous Pueblo chiles. It's a real city with over 110,000 people, so you get amenities, jobs, and culture.</p>

                <p>Cañon City sits in the Royal Gorge region, near the famous bridge and park. The town claims the longest Main Street in America, has several state prisons (Fremont County is prison central), and a growing wine and cidery scene.</p>

                <p>The Arkansas River runs through town, making it paradise for outdoor people: mountain biking, rock climbing, and whitewater rafting are all huge here. Many residents work for the Colorado prison system, but younger families are starting to move in as the local economy diversifies.</p>

                <h2 id="western-slope">The Western Slope: Mountains, Mesas &amp; Mountain Bikes</h2>

                <p>Southwest Colorado has some of the most stunning landscapes in the state—from the San Juan Mountains to Mesa Verde's ancient cliff dwellings. Prices are higher here because people want to live near this scenery, but compared to mountain towns like Aspen or Telluride, these are still bargains.</p>

                <h3 id="cortez">Cortez: Ancient History Meets Outdoor Access ($299.9k)</h3>

                <p><strong>Population:</strong> 9,105 | <strong>County:</strong> Montezuma | <strong>Median home price:</strong> $299,900<br>

                <p>Cortez sits between Mesa Verde National Park and Ute Mountain Tribal Park—two of the most impressive archaeological sites in the U.S. It's a small, quiet town that doesn't get much hype, but outdoor enthusiasts and history buffs genuinely love it here.</p>

                <p>Amenities are limited, and it's rural, but if you want to live near incredible hiking, ancient ruins, and genuine Southwest Colorado beauty without paying Telluride prices, Cortez is solid.</p>

                <p>Fruita is pricier than most towns on this list, but it's still "affordable" compared to other mountain biking destinations. The town is exploding in popularity thanks to world-class trails, proximity to Colorado National Monument, and access to wine country.</p>

                <p>Downtown is quiet—just a few shops and restaurants—but the outdoor scene is what brings people here. If mountain biking is your life and you want to be near incredible trails without paying Moab or Crested Butte prices, Fruita works.</p>

                <h2 id="northwest-colorado">Northwest Colorado: Remote, Wild &amp; Quiet</h2>

                <p>Northwestern Colorado borders Utah and Wyoming, and it's one of the most remote parts of the state. You get millions of acres of national forest, Steamboat's champagne powder nearby, and a whole lot of nothing in between.</p>

                <h3 id="craig">Craig: Elk Hunting Capital ($224k)</h3>

                <p>Craig sits 45 minutes west of Steamboat Springs, and it's basically the opposite of that resort town in every way. It's remote, quiet, and known as the "elk hunting capital of the world." Hunters come from everywhere during season.</p>

                <p>You've got direct access to Routt and White River National Forests, so outdoor recreation is covered. Jobs come from mining, oil and gas, and construction. Don't expect many restaurants or shops—this is a working town, not a tourist destination.</p>

                <p>Rifle sits along I-70 just west of Glenwood Springs, and it's often used as a cheaper alternative to staying in Glenwood. The town is home to Rifle Falls State Park and has a Colorado Mountain College campus, which brings in younger people.</p>

                <p>It's quiet and doesn't have a ton going on, but the I-70 access means you're connected to the rest of the state. If you work remotely or commute occasionally to Grand Junction or Glenwood, Rifle gives you mountain living without completely breaking the bank.</p>

                </ul>

                <h2 id="front-range-alternatives">Front Range Alternatives: Still Expensive, But Less So</h2>

                <p>These aren't cheap by national standards, but compared to Denver, Boulder, or Colorado Springs, they're deals. If you need to stay near the Front Range for work but can't stomach Denver prices, these might work.</p>

                <p>Greeley is 63 miles northeast of Denver and 31 miles from Fort Collins—prime location if you need Front Range access. There's a legit downtown with events, a craft beer scene, and the University of Northern Colorado brings in students and energy.</p>

                <p>JBS—the world's biggest meat protein producer—employs thousands here, so jobs exist beyond just service industry stuff. You get museums, historical sites, and access to outdoor recreation. It's not cheap anymore, but it's cheaper than Fort Collins or Denver.</p>

                <p>Fort Lupton sits just 28 miles northeast of Denver on the South Platte River. It's rural and quiet, but the proximity to Denver is the real selling point. You get city parks, an 18-hole golf course, and quirky attractions like the Vintage Aero Flying Museum.</p>

                <p>Jobs come from agriculture, energy, and manufacturing. Aims Community College is in town. Honestly, the biggest draw is simply being close to Denver without paying Denver prices—though at $471k, those savings are shrinking fast.</p>

                <h2 id="bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>

                <p>Affordable Colorado exists—you just have to leave the Front Range to find it. The trade-offs are real: fewer jobs, longer drives, smaller towns. But if remote work is an option or you're ready for a slower pace, these 15 towns prove you don't need $600k to own a home in Colorado.</p>
