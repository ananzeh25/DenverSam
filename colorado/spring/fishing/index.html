                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Lake fishing right after ice-off, tailwater rivers during runoff. <strong>License:</strong> Required for ages 16+, available online or at sporting goods stores. <strong>Peak times:</strong> Lakes March-May, rivers late May-June after runoff subsides. <strong>Top spots:</strong> Eleven Mile, Chatfield, South Platte tailwater, Blue River.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Spring fishing in Colorado tells a tale of two waters. Lakes are waking up - ice melts, water warms, and fish that spent winter in deep, cold water move to the shallows to feed aggressively. Meanwhile, rivers run high and often muddy with snowmelt, making fly fishing challenging until flows stabilize.</p>

                    <p>The key is knowing where to go and when. <strong>Lake fishing peaks right after ice-off</strong>, usually March and April depending on elevation. Colorado Parks & Wildlife stocks reservoirs and ponds heavily in spring, filling waters with hungry rainbow trout. Bank fishing and boat anglers alike find excellent action.</p>

                    <p>River anglers need patience. Runoff typically peaks in May and June, making many freestone streams unfishable. But <strong>tailwaters below dams</strong> - sections with regulated flows - can fish well all spring. These become your best bet until conditions stabilize.</p>

                    <h2 id="lakes">Lake Fishing Spots</h2>

                    <p><strong>Eleven Mile Reservoir</strong> is legendary among Colorado anglers. Located about 90 minutes from Denver, this state park offers trophy trout and pike fishing. Ice-off usually happens March through April, and the weeks immediately following are magical. Camping available if you want to fish dawn and dusk.</p>

                    <p><strong>Chatfield Reservoir</strong> sits close to Denver and gets stocked heavily. Rainbow trout, bass, and walleye provide variety. Easy shore access makes it great for families and beginners. The marina rents boats if you want to get on the water.</p>

                    <p><strong>Spinney Mountain Reservoir</strong> near Eleven Mile offers gold medal waters with trophy potential. Catch-and-release with artificial flies and lures only creates a quality fishery for serious anglers.</p>

                    <h2 id="rivers">River Options</h2>

                    <p><strong>South Platte Tailwater</strong> below Cheesman Reservoir fishes year-round. The dam-controlled flows stay clear even during runoff when other rivers blow out. Technical fishing - picky trout sipping tiny flies - but rewarding for those with patience.</p>

                    <p><strong>Blue River</strong> below Dillon Reservoir near Silverthorne offers consistent flows during spring. Large rainbow and brown trout inhabit this tailwater. Accessible from I-70, it's a convenient stop on the way to or from ski resorts.</p>

                    <p><strong>Frying Pan River</strong> below Ruedi Reservoir is another tailwater gem. Known for large trout and challenging fishing, it maintains fishable conditions while freestone rivers rage with snowmelt.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Spring Fishing Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Target lakes early in the season.</strong> Fish are hungry after winter and more aggressive than they'll be all year. Powerbait, worms, and small spinners work well for stocked trout.</p>

                    <p><strong>Check river flows before driving.</strong> USGS stream gauge data is available online. Rivers over 500 cfs are usually too high and muddy to fish effectively. Wait for dropping, clearing conditions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Get licensed.</strong> Colorado fishing license required for ages 16+. Annual and daily options available online through Colorado Parks & Wildlife or at sporting goods stores.</p>

                            <h4>When does ice-off happen?</h4>
                            <p>Varies by elevation and year. Lower reservoirs like Chatfield open March. Higher lakes like Eleven Mile usually April. Mountain lakes may hold ice into June.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I fish during runoff?</h4>
                            <p>Tailwaters below dams fish well during runoff. Freestone rivers are usually too high and muddy. Focus on lakes or tailwaters until flows drop.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">

                            <p>Many reservoirs have excellent shore fishing, especially in spring when fish move shallow. Boats help reach more water but aren't required.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What about warmwater fishing?</h4>
                            <p>Bass, walleye, and other warmwater species become active as water temps rise. Chatfield and Aurora Reservoir have good warmwater fisheries.</p>
