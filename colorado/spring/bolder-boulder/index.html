                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>When:</strong> Memorial Day morning each year (since 1979). <strong>Distance:</strong> 10K (6.2 miles). <strong>Participants:</strong> 50,000+ runners, joggers, walkers. <strong>Finish:</strong> Folsom Field at CU Boulder. <strong>Registration:</strong> Opens January, popular waves sell out.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Bolder Boulder isn't just a race - it's a 6.2-mile party through the streets of Boulder. Every Memorial Day, over 50,000 runners, joggers, and walkers traverse a course lined with live bands, belly dancers, Elvis impersonators, and enthusiastic spectators offering everything from beer to bacon.</p>

                    <p>The race finishes inside Folsom Field, CU Boulder's football stadium, where runners cross the line to cheering crowds. <strong>A Memorial Day tribute honors fallen service members</strong>, and elite international runners compete for prize money in the professional race that follows the citizen waves.</p>

                    <p>Speed doesn't matter for most participants - the experience of running through Boulder's neighborhoods with the Flatirons as backdrop is the point. It's equal parts athletic event, community celebration, and Memorial Day tradition.</p>

                    <h2 id="course">The Course</h2>

                    <p><strong>6.2 miles through Boulder neighborhoods</strong> on mostly residential streets. The course includes rolling hills - nothing brutal, but you'll notice them. Beautiful scenery with mountain views and tree-lined streets make the miles pass quickly.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>on-course entertainment</strong> is legendary. Over 30 bands play along the route, along with slip-n-slides, costume contests, and neighbors hosting front-yard parties. Some aid stations serve watermelon; others offer encouragement and cold spray on hot years.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>finish in Folsom Field</strong> is emotional. Running onto a football field with cheering crowds after 6.2 miles hits differently than finishing at a banner in a parking lot. It's designed to make everyone feel like a champion.</p>

                    <h2 id="waves">Wave System</h2>

                    <p>Participants are assigned to <strong>waves based on estimated finish times</strong>. Elite waves go first, with casual walkers in later waves. This spreads 50,000 people across several hours and keeps the course from getting too congested.</p>

                    <p><strong>Popular waves sell out</strong> - serious runners and walkers who want prime start times should register early when registration opens in January. Later waves are more relaxed and easier to get into.</p>

                    <h2 id="costumes">Costumes Welcome</h2>

                    <p><strong>Costumes are encouraged</strong> and creativity abounds. You'll see running bananas, superheroes, and elaborate group themes. Some people coordinate costumes with friends; others go solo. It's part race, part Halloween in May.</p>

                    <p>There's no pressure to dress up, but if you do, the crowds will appreciate it. Some of the most memorable moments are seeing creative costumes running past bands and belly dancers.</p>

                    <h2 id="memorial">Memorial Day Tribute</h2>

                    <p>The race is fundamentally a <strong>Memorial Day celebration</strong>. The ceremony in Folsom Field honors fallen service members, and the timing - running on a day set aside for remembrance - adds meaning to the event. It's festive but respectful, celebration and tribute intertwined.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Do I need to be a serious runner?</h4>
                            <p>No - many participants walk. There's no time limit for finishing. The event welcomes everyone from elite runners to casual walkers.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How do I get into a popular wave?</h4>
                            <p>Register early when registration opens in January. Faster estimated times get earlier waves. Later waves still experience everything, just later in the morning.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is it family-friendly?</h4>
                            <p>Very. Kids run in family waves, strollers are allowed in designated waves, and the course atmosphere is welcoming to all ages. The stadium finish is a shared experience.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What about parking and transportation?</h4>
                            <p>Parking is limited - the race encourages shuttles from Denver and satellite parking lots. RTD runs special buses. Plan transportation early and arrive with plenty of time.</p>
