                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>When:</strong> Four days each March. <strong>Where:</strong> Multiple venues in downtown Boulder. <strong>What:</strong> 100+ independent films, filmmaker Q&As, panels, and parties. <strong>Tickets:</strong> Individual screenings and festival passes available. VIP options for parties and priority seating.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Each March, Boulder transforms into a hub for independent cinema. The Boulder International Film Festival (BIFF) screens over 100 films across four days - documentaries, narratives, shorts, and works from Colorado filmmakers. It's become one of the most respected regional film festivals in the country.</p>

                    <p>What makes BIFF special is the intimacy. Unlike larger festivals where you might glimpse a director from across a crowded room, <strong>BIFF brings filmmakers to Boulder for genuine interaction</strong>. Q&As follow most screenings, panels dive into filmmaking topics, and the coffee shop next door might have you sitting beside someone whose work you just watched.</p>

                    <p>Many BIFF selections go on to major distribution or Oscar consideration. The programming team has an eye for quality, and attending feels like getting a preview of films you'll hear about later.</p>

                    <h2 id="films">Film Programming</h2>

                    <p><strong>Features and documentaries</strong> form the festival core. You'll find world and US premieres alongside festival circuit favorites. The documentary programming is particularly strong - Boulder audiences appreciate substantive, thought-provoking films.</p>

                    <p><strong>Short film programs</strong> bundle multiple shorts by theme. They're excellent for sampling the festival's range without committing to a single feature-length film.</p>

                    <p><strong>Colorado filmmaker showcases</strong> highlight local talent. The state's film industry is growing, and BIFF provides a platform for emerging voices from the region.</p>

                    <h2 id="experience">The BIFF Experience</h2>

                    <p><strong>Filmmaker Q&As</strong> happen after most screenings. Directors, writers, and cast discuss the creative process and answer audience questions. These conversations often reveal as much as the films themselves.</p>

                    <p><strong>Panels and workshops</strong> cover industry topics, filmmaking techniques, and Colorado production. They're valuable for aspiring filmmakers and fascinating for anyone interested in how movies get made.</p>

                    <p><strong>Opening and closing night galas</strong> premiere high-profile films with parties afterward. VIP passes include access to filmmaker lounges and networking events throughout the weekend.</p>

                    <h2 id="planning">Planning Your Visit</h2>

                    <p><strong>Tickets go fast</strong> for popular screenings. Festival passes offer guaranteed admission and VIP perks, but individual tickets work fine if you're selective. Check the schedule early and build your plan around must-sees.</p>

                    <p><strong>Downtown Boulder locations</strong> make logistics easy. Venues are walkable, with time between screenings to grab food on Pearl Street. Plan for potential weather - March in Colorado can be sunny or snowy.</p>
