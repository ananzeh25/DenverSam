                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Snow-free timing:</strong> Below 7,500 feet by late March, 9,000 feet by late May, high country June-July. <strong>Best early hikes:</strong> Garden of the Gods, Red Rocks, Roxborough, Castlewood Canyon. <strong>Essential gear:</strong> Layers, mud-ready boots, microspikes for lingering snow.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Spring hiking in Colorado requires flexibility. While high country trails remain buried under snow through May or June, lower elevations along the Front Range offer excellent hiking as early as March. The key is choosing the right elevation and being ready for variable conditions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Trails below 7,500 feet are typically snow-free by late March.</strong> Garden of the Gods, Red Rocks, Roxborough State Park, and Castlewood Canyon offer stunning hikes without needing traction devices. The weather can swing from 70 degrees to snow within hours, so always carry layers.</p>

                    <p>As spring progresses, more trails open. By late May, most trails up to 9,000 feet are accessible. The high country - fourteeners and alpine trails - generally opens in late June or July depending on snowpack.</p>

                    <h2 id="early-hikes">Best Early Season Hikes</h2>

                    <p><strong>Garden of the Gods</strong> in Colorado Springs is snow-free year-round. Red rock formations, multiple trails, and stunning views make it a perfect spring destination. Free admission, easy access, and trails for all abilities.</p>

                    <p><strong>Red Rocks Park</strong> near Denver offers trading post trails and surrounding paths that open early. Lower elevation means earlier access - just 20 minutes from downtown. Combine hiking with a concert if timing works.</p>

                    <p><strong>Roxborough State Park</strong> features dramatic red rock formations south of Denver. Multiple loop trails, wildlife viewing, and early spring access. The geology rivals Garden of the Gods with smaller crowds.</p>

                    <p><strong>Flatirons</strong> in Boulder - lower trails accessible by April, though higher routes may hold snow into May. Chautauqua area has options for all levels from flat meadow walks to challenging scrambles.</p>

                    <h2 id="mud-season">Mud Season</h2>

                    <p><strong>Snowmelt creates muddy trails</strong> at mid-elevations through spring. Waterproof boots are essential. Stay on trail to prevent erosion - don't widen muddy spots by walking around them. Some land managers close trails during mud season to prevent damage.</p>

                    <p>South-facing slopes dry out faster. Trails with good drainage or rocky surfaces fare better than dirt paths. Check recent trip reports before heading out.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Spring Hiking Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Layer up.</strong> Spring weather swings wildly - mornings cold, afternoons warm, storms possible anytime. Carry extra layers, rain jacket, and be ready for temperature drops. Don't let a sunny trailhead fool you.</p>

                    <p><strong>Check conditions before driving.</strong> Trail conditions vary widely by elevation and aspect. AllTrails, 14ers.com, and local ranger stations provide current reports. Snow lingers in shade long after sunny slopes clear.</p>

                    <p><strong>Carry traction devices.</strong> Microspikes or yaktrax are useful for icy patches on shaded trails. Carry them even if reports say mostly clear - you might encounter unexpected snow in gullies or north-facing sections.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>When can I hike fourteeners?</h4>
                            <p>Most fourteeners don't clear of snow until late June or July. Some have safe winter routes for experienced mountaineers, but casual hikers should wait for summer.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is spring hiking less crowded?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, generally - especially compared to summer and fall. Weekends at popular trailheads still draw crowds, but weekday mornings are quiet. Shoulder season means more solitude.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What about afternoon thunderstorms?</h4>
                            <p>Less common in spring than summer, but still possible. Start early and plan to be off exposed summits by early afternoon. Watch building clouds and don't ignore lightning risk.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Should I avoid mud season?</h4>
                            <p>Not entirely - just choose appropriate trails. Lower elevation trails with rocky surfaces work fine. Avoid soft dirt trails at mid-elevations until they dry. Following closure signs helps protect trails.</p>
