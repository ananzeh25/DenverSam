                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Peak bloom:</strong> Varies by elevation - lower valleys May-June, montane meadows June-July, alpine tundra July-August. <strong>Best spots:</strong> Crested Butte (Wildflower Capital), American Basin, Guanella Pass, Rocky Mountain National Park. <strong>Key flowers:</strong> Columbine, Indian paintbrush, lupine, alpine sunflower.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Colorado's wildflower season is one of nature's great shows. As snow melts, waves of color sweep across the mountains - starting at lower elevations in late April and climbing to alpine meadows by July. At peak bloom, entire hillsides transform into carpets of blue columbine, red Indian paintbrush, and yellow sunflowers.</p>

                    <p>The timing is everything, and it varies by elevation. <strong>Lower valleys (7,000-8,000 feet)</strong> bloom May through early June. <strong>Montane meadows (8,000-10,000 feet)</strong> peak June through mid-July. <strong>Alpine tundra above treeline</strong> explodes with tiny, intense blooms in late July and August.</p>

                    <p>Crested Butte has earned the title "Wildflower Capital of Colorado" and hosts an annual festival in July. But spectacular displays occur throughout the mountains - you just need to know when and where to look.</p>

                    <h2 id="crested-butte">Crested Butte</h2>

                    <p><strong>Crested Butte</strong> takes wildflowers seriously. The surrounding meadows and trails produce some of Colorado's most spectacular displays, and the town celebrates with a Wildflower Festival each July featuring guided hikes, photography workshops, and flower identification classes.</p>

                    <p><strong>Snodgrass Trail</strong> and <strong>Gothic Road</strong> are legendary viewing spots. The historic mining town of Gothic sits amid prime wildflower territory. Even casual roadside stops along County Road 317 reveal stunning displays.</p>

                    <h2 id="american-basin">American Basin</h2>

                    <p><strong>American Basin</strong> near Lake City might be Colorado's single most spectacular wildflower location. A high alpine basin surrounded by fourteeners, it erupts with color in late June through July. The drive requires a high-clearance vehicle, but the reward is a carpet of wildflowers stretching across an entire mountain amphitheater.</p>

                    <p>Go early morning for best light and fewer people. Midweek visits offer more solitude.</p>

                    <h2 id="accessible">Accessible Locations</h2>

                    <p><strong>Guanella Pass</strong> offers beautiful displays just 90 minutes from Denver. The scenic byway climbs through wildflower meadows June through July, with easy roadside viewing and short hikes. No high-clearance vehicle required.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rocky Mountain National Park</strong> provides accessible wildflower viewing at multiple elevations. Lower trails bloom earlier, while the alpine tundra along Trail Ridge Road peaks in late July.</p>

                    <h2 id="flowers">Common Colorado Wildflowers</h2>

                    <p><strong>Colorado Columbine</strong> - The state flower. Blue and white blooms from June through August, found in aspen groves and shaded areas. Protected by law - don't pick them.</p>

                    <p><strong>Indian Paintbrush</strong> - Brilliant red-orange clusters that seem to glow in meadows. Blooms May through September at various elevations.</p>

                    <p><strong>Lupine</strong> - Tall purple spikes covering entire meadows. June and July at mid elevations. Especially stunning near Crested Butte.</p>

                    <p><strong>Alpine Sunflower</strong> - Also called Old Man of the Mountain. Found above treeline, blooms once after years of growth, then dies.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>When is peak wildflower season?</h4>
                            <p>Depends on elevation and snowpack. Generally mid-June through mid-July for most mountain areas. Check local reports for specific timing each year.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is Crested Butte worth the drive?</h4>
                            <p>If you're serious about wildflowers, yes. The concentration and variety exceed most other areas. The Wildflower Festival in July adds educational programming.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I pick wildflowers?</h4>
                            <p>Generally no. Colorado Columbine is specifically protected, and most public lands prohibit picking flowers. Leave them for others to enjoy.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Best photography tips?</h4>
                            <p>Early morning light is best. Get low to the ground for intimate shots. Overcast days reduce harsh shadows and saturate colors.</p>
