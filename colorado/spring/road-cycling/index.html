                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Best conditions:</strong> April through May, 50s-70s temps. <strong>Top routes:</strong> Cherry Creek Trail, Boulder Canyon, Lookout Mountain, Platte River Trail. <strong>Tips:</strong> Dress in layers, watch for afternoon wind, beware altitude if visiting from sea level.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Spring brings Colorado's best road cycling conditions. Temperatures hover in the 50s to 70s - warm enough to ride comfortably but cool enough to push hard. Denver's extensive trail system is snow-free, and the mountain canyon roads beckon with stunning scenery.</p>

                    <p>Colorado's cycling culture is legendary. Boulder consistently ranks among America's best cycling cities, and Denver's urban trail network covers over 850 miles. The Front Range offers everything from flat bike paths to challenging mountain climbs within easy reach.</p>

                    <p>Spring is base-building season for serious cyclists, but perfect for casual riders too. <strong>Mornings start cool and warm beautifully. Afternoon thunderstorms are less common than summer.</strong> It's the window between winter winds and summer heat that cyclists treasure.</p>

                    <h2 id="trails">Urban Trails</h2>

                    <p><strong>Cherry Creek Trail</strong> runs 40 miles from downtown Denver to Franktown. Paved path along the creek connects to Denver's extensive urban trail network. Flat and scenic, it's perfect for long easy rides or commuting.</p>

                    <p><strong>Platte River Trail</strong> forms Denver's cycling spine, running through the city and connecting to trails in every direction. The path passes through downtown, RiNo, and Confluence Park. Flat, paved, and ideal for combining cycling with urban exploration.</p>

                    <h2 id="climbs">Canyon Climbs</h2>

                    <p><strong>Boulder Canyon</strong> is the classic Front Range climb - 16 miles from Boulder to Nederland with 2,500 feet of climbing. Shared road with traffic but wide shoulders. The views of Boulder Creek and canyon walls reward the effort.</p>

                    <p><strong>Lookout Mountain</strong> from Golden is famous among cyclists. 4.5 miles, 1,300 feet of climbing with switchbacks and mountain views. The route finishes at Buffalo Bill's grave with Denver panoramas. Popular with racers training - expect company on nice days.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Spring Cycling Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Dress in layers.</strong> Mornings are cold, afternoons warm. Arm warmers and a vest you can remove work well. Temperature swings of 30+ degrees are common spring to afternoon.</p>

                    <p><strong>Watch the wind.</strong> Spring brings Colorado's windiest days. Plan routes to have wind at your back on the return. Afternoon gusts can be brutal - morning rides often have calmer conditions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Altitude matters.</strong> Denver sits at 5,280 feet. Expect reduced performance if visiting from sea level. Hydrate more, push less the first few days until you acclimate.</p>

                    <p><strong>Sun protection.</strong> High altitude means intense UV. Sunscreen, sunglasses, and arm covers prevent burns. The thin air doesn't filter as much radiation - you'll burn faster than expected.</p>
