                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>When:</strong> March or April (dates vary). <strong>Where:</strong> Denver venue (changes annually). <strong>What:</strong> 100+ collaboration beers brewed specifically for this event - when they're gone, they're gone forever. <strong>Tickets:</strong> General admission and VIP available. Sells out - buy early.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Collaboration Fest is unlike any other beer festival. Instead of pouring their regular offerings, breweries partner up to create unique beers made specifically for this one event. <strong>You won't find these beers anywhere else - when they're gone, they're gone forever.</strong></p>

                    <p>The concept celebrates the cooperative spirit of Colorado's craft beer community. Brewers who normally compete share recipes, techniques, and equipment. Unexpected pairings lead to creative experimentation - a stout brewer might team up with a sour specialist, or a tiny new brewery might collaborate with an industry legend.</p>

                    <p>Held each spring in Denver, the festival features over 100 collaboration beers from breweries across Colorado and beyond. It's a chance to taste innovation at its peak.</p>

                    <h2 id="beers">The Collaboration Beers</h2>

                    <p><strong>Every beer on tap was created specifically for the festival.</strong> Partnerships range from neighboring breweries to cross-country and international teams. The stories behind each collaboration are often as interesting as the beers themselves.</p>

                    <p>Styles run the full spectrum. You might find a Mexican lager collaboration between a Colorado brewery and one from Mexico City, a barrel-aged stout from two renowned dark beer specialists, or something completely experimental. The format encourages brewers to take risks.</p>

                    <p><strong>These beers won't be brewed again.</strong> The one-time-only nature adds urgency - if you taste something amazing, savor it. You'll never have it again.</p>

                    <h2 id="experience">The Festival Experience</h2>

                    <p><strong>Brewers pour their own creations</strong> and tell the stories behind them. Unlike festivals where volunteers pour from kegs, here you're getting the beer directly from its makers. Ask about the creative process, what inspired the collaboration, what challenges they faced.</p>

                    <p>The atmosphere is festive but focused. This isn't a party where beer happens to be present - it's a celebration of brewing creativity where serious beer people come to taste innovation.</p>

                    <p><strong>VIP sessions</strong> offer early access with smaller crowds. If you're serious about tasting widely, VIP is worth the premium.</p>

                    <h2 id="tickets">Getting Tickets</h2>

                    <p><strong>Tickets sell out.</strong> Purchase early when they go on sale. General admission typically includes festival entry and a tasting glass. VIP adds early access and fewer people.</p>

                    <p>The festival is 21+ only. Plan transportation - this is a tasting event with over 100 beers available.</p>

                            <p>No - collaboration beers are brewed only for the festival. When they run out at the event, they're gone forever. That's the whole point.</p>
