                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Season:</strong> September through October. <strong>Top spots:</strong> Crested Butte, Breckenridge, Trestle Bike Park, Front Range trails. <strong>Conditions:</strong> Dry trails, perfect temps, fewer crowds. <strong>Note:</strong> High-altitude trails may close with early snow.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Fall mountain biking in Colorado is special. The summer crowds vanish after Labor Day. Trails that required dawn starts in August are yours at 10 AM in September. Temperatures drop into perfect riding range - cool enough to push hard without overheating.</p>

                    <p>The trails are at their best. August monsoons are over, leaving dry, tacky conditions. Dust settles, grip improves, and corners that were sketchy in July become predictable. <strong>Riding through golden aspen tunnels is a uniquely Colorado experience.</strong> Leaves crunch under your tires, golden light filters through the canopy, and even familiar trails feel transformed.</p>

                    <h2 id="destinations">Top Fall Riding Spots</h2>

                    <p><strong>Crested Butte</strong> is the birthplace of mountain biking, and fall is prime season. The 401 Trail through peak color is bucket-list riding. Evolution Bike Park extends into fall. Aspens carpet the hills in gold.</p>

                    <p><strong>Breckenridge</strong> offers high-altitude singletrack with spectacular fall color. Colorado Trail access and Keystone bike park (often open into October) make it a destination. Less crowded than summer months.</p>

                    <p><strong>Trestle Bike Park</strong> at Winter Park usually runs through early October. Fewer crowds, perfect temps, fall color along the trails. Extended season bonus for downhill riders.</p>

                    <p><strong>Front Range trails</strong> like Buffalo Creek, White Ranch, and Hall Ranch are close to Denver. Lower elevation means longer season. Great after-work riding through October when mountain trails may be snowed in.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Fall Riding Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Layer up.</strong> Mornings are cold, descents are colder. Bring a packable layer for summit and downhill. Arm warmers and a vest work well for the temperature swings.</p>

                    <p><strong>Check conditions.</strong> High-altitude trails can get early snow. Check recent reports before heading up. An early October snowstorm can close trails suddenly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Be aware of hunting season.</strong> Rifle season starts in October. Wear bright colors in backcountry. Consider Front Range trails during peak hunting weeks to avoid conflicts.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How long does fall riding season last?</h4>
                            <p>High mountain trails typically ride well through late September, sometimes early October. Front Range trails can be good through November. First significant snow usually closes high-altitude options.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Which bike parks stay open latest?</h4>
                            <p>Trestle at Winter Park usually runs into early October. Keystone often extends through September. Check individual resort schedules - they vary by year and conditions.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What about muddy trails?</h4>
                            <p>Fall is generally dry in Colorado. Avoid riding wet trails - they damage easily. If trails are muddy from rain or snowmelt, give them a day to dry. Check trail status reports.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>When is 401 Trail at peak color?</h4>
                            <p>Usually late September, but timing varies by year. Check Crested Butte color reports. The trail is worth the trip even without peak color - but with gold aspens, it's transcendent.</p>
