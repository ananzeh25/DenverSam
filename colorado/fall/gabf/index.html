                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>When:</strong> Three days in October (Thursday-Saturday). <strong>Where:</strong> Colorado Convention Center, Denver. <strong>What:</strong> 800+ breweries, 4,000+ beers, medals competition. <strong>Tickets:</strong> Sell out in minutes - join AHA for presale access.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Great American Beer Festival is the Super Bowl of craft beer. Every October, over 800 breweries descend on the Colorado Convention Center to pour 4,000+ different beers for 60,000 attendees across three days. Tickets sell out in minutes when they go on sale.</p>

                    <p>But GABF is more than just a drinking event. <strong>It's home to the most prestigious brewing competition in America.</strong> Medals awarded here can make or break a brewery's reputation. Judges evaluate thousands of entries across nearly 100 style categories, and winners display their medals with pride for years.</p>

                    <h2 id="experience">The Festival Experience</h2>

                    <p><strong>Unlimited sampling</strong> from 800+ breweries in one-ounce pours. You can sample across the entire hall or focus on specific regions or styles. Plan your strategy - there's more beer here than any person could taste in a lifetime.</p>

                    <p><strong>Meet the brewers.</strong> Many pour their own beer, giving you the chance to talk directly with the people who made it. Ask questions, learn stories, geek out. It's like backstage passes to American brewing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Competition results</strong> are announced Saturday. Gold, silver, and bronze medals in nearly 100 categories. Look for "medal winner" signs at booths and try the winners. The competition adds stakes beyond just tasting.</p>

                    <h2 id="tickets">Getting Tickets</h2>

                    <p><strong>Tickets sell out fast.</strong> August sale typically goes in minutes - sometimes seconds. Set alarms and be ready. No day-of sales. If you miss the general sale, your GABF dreams are over for the year.</p>

                    <p><strong>Join American Homebrewers Association</strong> for presale access. Members get first crack at tickets before the general public. It's the best way to guarantee entry. Join before tickets drop.</p>

                    <p><strong>Book hotels early.</strong> Denver fills up during GABF. Stay downtown to walk to and from the convention center - you won't want to drive after the festival. Public transit also works well.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Which session is best?</h4>
                            <p>Thursday evening is members-only and least crowded. Saturday afternoon is most competitive for tickets and most crowded. Friday and Saturday evening balance well.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How many beers can I realistically try?</h4>
                            <p>Sessions are 4 hours with one-ounce pours. Serious tasters hit 40-60 beers. Pace yourself, drink water, eat before arriving, and be strategic about what you want to try.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is there food inside?</h4>
                            <p>Food vendors are available but eating before you arrive is smart. Lines can be long and you don't want to waste tasting time. A solid meal before the session helps pace your drinking.</p>
