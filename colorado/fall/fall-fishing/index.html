                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Peak season:</strong> October and November (brown trout spawn). <strong>Top waters:</strong> South Platte, Arkansas River, Roaring Fork, Blue River. <strong>Key flies:</strong> Streamers, BWO dries. <strong>Tip:</strong> Respect spawning fish and avoid walking on redds.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Fall transforms Colorado fishing. Brown trout spawn in October and November, becoming territorial and aggressive. These normally cautious fish suddenly attack streamers and chase smaller fish from their redds. It's the time of year when trophy browns are most catchable.</p>

                    <p>The spawn brings browns from deep pools and undercut banks where they hide all summer. <strong>Large fish that would never look at a fly in July will hammer a streamer in October.</strong> They move to gravelly shallows, becoming visible and accessible. It's thrilling fishing when conditions align.</p>

                    <h2 id="waters">Top Fall Waters</h2>

                    <p><strong>South Platte</strong> offers multiple excellent sections. Deckers and Cheesman Canyon for technical dry fly fishing. Dream Stream for spawning browns. Eleven Mile Canyon for variety. Something for every angler within two hours of Denver.</p>

                    <p><strong>Arkansas River</strong> has 100+ miles of Gold Medal water with big browns on the move. Salida and Buena Vista sections fish well. October streamer fishing is outstanding. The longest trout river in Colorado delivers consistently.</p>

                    <p><strong>Roaring Fork</strong> near Aspen combines excellent fall fishing with spectacular foliage. Brown trout move upstream to spawn. The scenic setting during peak color makes it special even when the fishing is slow.</p>

                    <p><strong>Blue River</strong> tailwater below Dillon Reservoir holds big fish year-round. Fall kokanee salmon run attracts trophy browns. Pink and orange patterns imitating salmon eggs can produce explosive takes.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Fall Fishing Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Think streamers.</strong> Aggressive browns eat big flies. Woolly Buggers, sculpin patterns, and articulated streamers. Strip aggressively to trigger territorial strikes. Go bigger than you think.</p>

                    <p><strong>Watch for BWOs.</strong> Blue-winged olive mayflies hatch on cloudy fall days. Small dry flies (size 18-22) can produce excellent dry fly fishing on overcast afternoons. One of the year's best hatches.</p>

                    <p><strong>Respect spawning fish.</strong> Avoid walking on redds (gravel nests). Handle fish carefully for quick release. Consider skipping obvious spawning areas. The future of the fishery depends on successful spawning.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is it ethical to fish during the spawn?</h4>
                            <p>Opinions vary. Many anglers avoid actively spawning fish but fish nearby. If you catch spawning fish, handle quickly and release immediately. Never target fish visibly on redds. Use single barbless hooks for easy release.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What's the best time of day?</h4>
                            <p>Midday often fishes best in fall - water warms slightly and fish become more active. BWO hatches typically occur between noon and 3 PM on overcast days. Morning can be slow until water temps rise.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How should I dress for fall fishing?</h4>
                            <p>Waders with insulation layers. Fingerless gloves help with cold hands. Conditions change quickly - bring extra layers. A warm hat makes a big difference during cold mornings.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Are rivers crowded in fall?</h4>
                            <p>Much less than summer. Crowds disappear after Labor Day. You'll often have long stretches to yourself. Fall is many experienced anglers' favorite season for this reason.</p>
