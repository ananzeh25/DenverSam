                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>When:</strong> Mid-September to mid-October (peak late September). <strong>Where:</strong> Estes Park, Rocky Mountain NP, Evergreen. <strong>Best time:</strong> Dawn and dusk. <strong>Safety:</strong> Keep 25+ yards distance - bulls are aggressive during rut.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Every September and October, a haunting sound echoes through Colorado's mountain valleys. Bull elk bugle - a high-pitched whistle followed by deep grunts - challenging rivals and advertising to cows. It's one of nature's most dramatic spectacles, and Colorado is one of the best places in the world to witness it.</p>

                    <p>During the rut, bulls gather harems of cows and defend them aggressively from other males. <strong>You'll see massive bulls with racks spanning five feet strutting, sparring, and occasionally fighting.</strong> Antlers clash, bulls throw their heads back to bugle, and the competition plays out in meadows, parks, and even on golf courses.</p>

                    <h2 id="locations">Best Viewing Locations</h2>

                    <p><strong>Estes Park</strong> is the easiest place to watch the rut. Elk wander into town, graze in yards, and hold forth on the local golf course. You can view wildlife while having dinner downtown. It's remarkably accessible.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rocky Mountain National Park</strong> offers more wilderness settings. Moraine Park and Horseshoe Park are hotspots where rangers manage crowds during peak viewing. The setting is more dramatic, with mountain backdrops framing the action.</p>

                    <p><strong>Evergreen</strong> is closer to Denver, about 45 minutes from the city. Elk roam the foothills year-round, with Evergreen Lake area and nearby open spaces offering regular sightings during the rut.</p>

                    <p><strong>Western Slope</strong> locations near Gunnison, Ridgway, and other western Colorado towns offer less crowded viewing. Larger herds, fewer tourists, more wilderness feel.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Viewing Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Go at dawn or dusk.</strong> Elk are most active during low-light hours. Full moon nights can be spectacular - bulls bugle throughout the night. Bring binoculars or a spotting scope.</p>

                    <p><strong>Keep your distance.</strong> Bulls are aggressive during rut - 25 yards minimum, more if the elk seem agitated. Never approach or block their path. They're wild animals that can move fast and hit hard.</p>

                    <p><strong>Listen first.</strong> The bugle is unforgettable - a high whistle followed by grunts. You'll hear them before you see them. Turn off your car engine and roll down the windows to listen.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>When exactly is peak rut?</h4>
                            <p>Late September through early October typically sees the most activity. Weather affects timing - cooler temperatures encourage more daytime activity. The full moon often triggers especially intense bugling.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I photograph the elk?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, with a long lens (200mm+ recommended). Tripod helps for dawn/dusk light. Patience required - action happens unpredictably. Never approach for a better shot. Use your zoom, not your feet.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How crowded does it get?</h4>
                            <p>Estes Park and RMNP draw significant crowds during peak rut weekends. Weekday visits are much less hectic. Evening viewing is often less crowded than morning. The elk don't seem to mind the audience.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is it safe to view from my car?</h4>
                            <p>Yes - viewing from your vehicle is actually recommended and often provides the best experience. Elk are accustomed to cars but can be spooked by people on foot. Pull safely off the road and watch from inside.</p>
