                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Best spots:</strong> Keystone Lake, Evergreen Lake, Vail Village, Denver downtown rinks. <strong>Cost:</strong> $5-20 for rink access plus $5-15 for skate rentals. <strong>Season:</strong> Mid-November through February (weather dependent). <strong>Bring:</strong> Warm layers, thick socks, gloves.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Picture gliding across a frozen lake with snow-capped peaks rising in every direction. That's Colorado ice skating at its best - a postcard winter moment you can actually live. From natural frozen lakes to European-style village rinks, the state offers skating experiences you won't find anywhere else.</p>

                    <p>The options split into two categories: <strong>natural frozen lakes</strong> and <strong>maintained rinks</strong>. Lakes offer vast open space and mountain views but depend on cold weather. Rinks are smaller but more reliable. Both have their magic.</p>

                    <p>This isn't hockey rink skating (though Keystone has that too). This is romantic, nostalgic, fresh-air skating. The kind where you stop to take photos of the mountains, warm up with hot cocoa, and feel genuinely enchanted by winter.</p>

                    <h2 id="keystone">Keystone Lake</h2>

                    <p><strong>Keystone's lakeside rink</strong> is one of the largest outdoor skating surfaces in North America - 5 acres of groomed ice at the base of the ski resort. It's massive enough for hockey games, broomball, and family skating to happen simultaneously without crowding.</p>

                    <p>The setting is spectacular. Ski runs rise above the lake, the village is steps away, and the ice quality is maintained to rink standards despite being natural. Sessions run throughout the day and into the evening when lights illuminate the lake.</p>

                    <p>Skate rentals are available at the lakeside rental shop. It gets busy on weekends and holidays, but the size absorbs crowds well.</p>

                    <h2 id="evergreen">Evergreen Lake</h2>

                    <p><strong>Evergreen Lake</strong> is Colorado's classic skating destination - a natural frozen lake just 45 minutes from Denver. It's been a local tradition since the 1960s, and the experience hasn't changed much: glide across the lake, warm up in the historic warming house, repeat.</p>

                    <p>The lake is monitored by the city, with sections cleared and marked when conditions are safe. When it's open, flags fly to signal safe ice. When conditions are marginal or warming, the lake closes. Check before you go - Colorado's variable weather means conditions change rapidly.</p>

                    <p>The warming house sells hot cocoa and snacks. Skate rentals available. The surrounding trails are beautiful for a pre-skate walk. Get there early on weekends - parking fills up.</p>

                    <h2 id="village-rinks">Village Rinks</h2>

                    <p><strong>Vail and Beaver Creek</strong> have charming village rinks surrounded by shops and restaurants. They're smaller than the lakes but offer European atmosphere - think Christmas markets and twinkling lights. The setting is intimate and romantic, especially in the evening.</p>

                    <p>These rinks are less about skating marathons and more about the experience. Skate for 30 minutes, grab dinner, wander the village. It's skating as part of a village evening, not the main event.</p>

                    <h2 id="denver">Denver Rinks</h2>

                    <p><strong>Downtown Denver</strong> has seasonal rinks that appear each winter. The Skyline Park rink is the main attraction - smaller than mountain rinks but convenient for city dwellers. Holiday lights, city views, and walkable access to restaurants make it a good evening activity.</p>

                    <p>The Southwest Rink at Civic Center offers another urban option. These aren't destination skating experiences, but they're solid for local outings without driving to the mountains.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Skating Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Dress warmer than you think.</strong> You're standing still on ice much of the time, not generating heat like skiing. Layers, gloves, and a warm hat are essential. Consider bringing hand warmers for cold days.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bring thick socks</strong> for rental skates. Thin socks lead to cold feet and blisters. Wool or thick athletic socks work best. Rental skates vary in quality - if they're uncomfortable, ask to switch.</p>

                    <p><strong>Helmets for beginners.</strong> Adults skip them, but kids and anyone unsteady should wear one. Ice is hard, and falls happen. Most rinks have helmets available.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is Evergreen Lake always open in winter?</h4>
                            <p>No - it depends on ice conditions. Warm spells can close the lake for days or weeks. Check Evergreen Park and Recreation's website or call before driving up.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I bring my own skates?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, all rinks welcome personal skates. If you skate regularly, owning skates is worth it - rentals vary in quality and fit.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What about hockey skates vs figure skates?</h4>
                            <p>Either works for recreational skating. Hockey skates are easier for beginners because there's no toe pick to trip on. Figure skates allow more graceful stops and turns once you're comfortable.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is evening skating available?</h4>
                            <p>Keystone has evening hours with lights. Village rinks stay open into evening. Evergreen Lake closes at sunset. Check specific rink hours.</p>
