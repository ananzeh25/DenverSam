                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Remote San Juan Mountains valley, about 1 hour from Telluride. <strong>What makes it special:</strong> Restored 1800s ghost town, ultra-luxury all-inclusive, natural hot springs. <strong>Cost:</strong> From $2,000+/night. Overnight guests only.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Dunton Hot Springs is unlike any other hot springs in Colorado - or anywhere else. This restored 1800s ghost town sits at 9,000 feet in a remote valley of the San Juan Mountains, accessible only by dirt road. Hand-hewn log cabins have been meticulously restored and outfitted with world-class luxury. Natural hot springs flow through the property.</p>

                    <p>The experience is all-inclusive and exclusive. The entire property accommodates only about 40 guests at a time. Rates start around $2,000 per night, and the waiting list for winter dates can stretch months. This isn't a casual hot springs stop - it's a destination resort for those seeking the ultimate Colorado experience.</p>

                    <p>For those who can access it, Dunton delivers something extraordinary. Soaking in a natural hot spring inside a restored bathhouse while snow falls outside, then warming up by the fire in a cabin that Butch Cassidy once visited - it's a uniquely Colorado fantasy made real.</p>

                    <h2 id="experience">The Experience</h2>

                    <p>Multiple <strong>natural hot springs</strong> dot the property. There's an indoor bathhouse with pools and an outdoor pool with mountain views. Source water emerges at 106°F. Soak anytime day or night - one of the perks of staying on property.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>historic cabins</strong> have been restored with extraordinary attention to detail. Original mining-era structures with heated floors, fine linens, and authentic character. Each cabin is unique - no two are alike. The combination of rustic authenticity and modern luxury is the Dunton signature.</p>

                    <p><strong>All meals</strong> are included and outstanding. Farm-to-table cuisine served in the restored saloon. The wine cellar is housed in an old mine shaft. Communal dining creates an intimate atmosphere where guests get to know each other.</p>

                    <p><strong>True isolation</strong> is part of the experience. No cell service. No Wi-Fi in cabins (deliberately). The focus is on disconnection, presence, and nature. Digital detox is included whether you want it or not.</p>

                    <h2 id="winter">Winter Activities</h2>

                    <p><strong>Heli-skiing</strong> is available for those who want the ultimate - accessing pristine San Juan powder via helicopter. Expert guides, untouched terrain, then back to hot springs for recovery. The combination is hard to match.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cross-country skiing and snowshoeing</strong> on groomed trails and through the surrounding wilderness. Equipment provided. Return to hot springs after exploring.</p>

                    <p><strong>Yoga and wellness</strong> sessions are available. Massage and bodywork on request. The entire property is designed for renewal.</p>

                    <h2 id="planning">Planning Your Visit</h2>

                    <p><strong>Book well in advance</strong> - months ahead for peak winter dates. Minimum stays may apply. This is overnight guests only; day visits aren't available.</p>

                    <p>Getting there takes about <strong>1 hour from Telluride</strong> via dirt road. 4WD recommended. Transfer service is available if you don't want to drive yourself. The remoteness is by design.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>cost is significant</strong> - $2,000+ per night. But it's all-inclusive: lodging, all meals, wine, activities. For special occasions, honeymoons, milestone celebrations, it delivers something money can't easily buy elsewhere.</p>

                    <h2 id="alternatives">If Dunton's Out of Reach</h2>

                    <p>Let's be honest: most people can't afford Dunton. And that's fine - Colorado has excellent hot springs at every price point. <a href="/colorado/winter/hot-springs/glenwood/">Glenwood</a> and <a href="/colorado/winter/hot-springs/ouray/">Ouray</a> offer great experiences for $20-30. Dunton is aspirational for most of us, and there's no shame in visiting the other springs that deliver genuine Colorado hot springs magic without the luxury price tag.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I visit Dunton for just the day?</h4>
                            <p>No. Dunton is for overnight guests only. You must book a cabin stay to access the property and hot springs.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is it really worth $2,000+ per night?</h4>
                            <p>For the right occasion, many say yes. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience - restored ghost town, incredible setting, outstanding food, true isolation. But it's absolutely a splurge.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How remote is it?</h4>
                            <p>Very. Dirt road access only, about an hour from Telluride. No cell service. That isolation is intentional and part of what makes it special.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is it good for families?</h4>
                            <p>Dunton welcomes families, but the atmosphere is quiet and adult-oriented. Kids need to be comfortable with peaceful, nature-focused activities rather than adventure parks.</p>
