                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Idaho Springs, just 40 minutes from Denver on I-70. <strong>What makes it special:</strong> Underground geothermal caves, closest natural hot springs to Denver. <strong>Experience:</strong> Historic, funky, unpretentious.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Indian Hot Springs in Idaho Springs is the closest natural hot springs to Denver - just 40 minutes up I-70. This accessibility makes it perfect for a spontaneous weeknight soak or a quick getaway when you don't have time for a longer mountain trip.</p>

                    <p>The springs have been used for centuries, first by the Ute and Arapaho peoples, later by miners seeking relief from their labors. The current resort dates to 1905 and retains much of its historic character. The underground geothermal caves are the unique draw - natural rock chambers where steam rises from the earth.</p>

                    <p>The experience is different from Colorado's more polished hot springs. Indian Hot Springs has a funky, old-school vibe. The facilities are showing their age, but that's part of the charm for regulars who appreciate the authentic, unpretentious atmosphere.</p>

                    <h2 id="caves">Geothermal Caves</h2>

                    <p>The <strong>underground caves</strong> are the signature experience and unlike anything else in Colorado. Natural rock chambers filled with geothermal steam create a dark, warm, otherworldly atmosphere. It's not really a pool - more like a steam room carved by nature. Some people find it profoundly relaxing; others find it claustrophobic. Worth trying at least once.</p>

                    <h2 id="options">Other Soaking Options</h2>

                    <p><strong>Private baths</strong> are available by reservation - individual rooms with soaking tubs filled with hot mineral water. Good for couples or anyone wanting solitude.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>outdoor pool</strong> is a more conventional hot springs experience, open seasonally. Larger and more social than the caves or private baths.</p>

                    <p><strong>Mud baths</strong> are available as a spa add-on. Mineral mud treatments with claimed therapeutic benefits. Unique offering among Colorado springs.</p>

                    <h2 id="access">Easy Access</h2>

                    <p>Indian Hot Springs is <strong>right off I-70</strong> at the Idaho Springs exit. Free parking, no mountain passes required. Accessible year-round regardless of weather - you're not climbing to some remote valley.</p>

                    <p>This makes it a perfect <strong>après-ski stop</strong> on the way back from ski resorts. Loveland and A-Basin are nearby. Soak out your ski legs without adding hours to your drive home.</p>

                    <h2 id="idaho-springs">While You're Here</h2>

                    <p>Idaho Springs is a <strong>historic mining town</strong> with restaurants and shops. <a href="/idaho-springs">Beau Jo's pizza</a> is famous for their mountain pies - crust so thick you dip it in honey. Georgetown is nearby for more historic district exploring and the <a href="/idaho-springs/georgetown-loop/">Georgetown Loop Railroad</a>.</p>

                    <h2 id="expectations">Set Expectations</h2>

                    <p>This is <strong>not a luxury resort experience</strong>. Facilities are older, the vibe is casual, and you're not getting the polish of Glenwood or Iron Mountain. Embrace the funky character, and you'll enjoy it. Expect a spa resort, and you'll be disappointed. Great value for the proximity to Denver.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What are the geothermal caves like?</h4>
                            <p>Dark, steamy underground chambers. You sit in the warm steam rather than in a pool. Otherworldly and unique to Colorado. Some love it, some find it too intense.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is it worth stopping on the way back from skiing?</h4>
                            <p>Absolutely. It's right off I-70, no detour required. Perfect for loosening up ski-tired muscles before the rest of the drive home.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Are the facilities dated?</h4>
                            <p>Yes. This isn't a modern spa resort. If that bothers you, go to Glenwood instead. If you appreciate old-school authenticity, you'll like it here.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Do I need reservations?</h4>
                            <p>Recommended for private baths and caves, especially on weekends. The outdoor pool is more walk-in friendly when it's open.</p>
