                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Downtown Ouray, in a box canyon surrounded by 13,000-foot peaks. <strong>What makes it special:</strong> Sulfur-free water, stunning mountain views, municipal pricing (~$20). <strong>Pool temps:</strong> 96-106°F across multiple sections.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Ouray Hot Springs Pool offers one of Colorado's most dramatic hot springs settings. The town of Ouray sits in a box canyon surrounded by towering 13,000-foot San Juan peaks. From the pool, you're surrounded by mountains on all sides - a natural amphitheater of rock and snow.</p>

                    <p>Unlike many Colorado hot springs, Ouray's water is <strong>sulfur-free</strong>, meaning no rotten-egg smell. The naturally filtered mineral water comes from several springs and is odorless and clear. It's a welcome difference for visitors sensitive to the sulfur common at other locations.</p>

                    <p>The municipally-owned pool has served visitors since 1927. Recent renovations added new pools while maintaining the historic character. It's a community gathering spot for locals and a bucket-list destination for visitors - affordable, accessible, and absolutely stunning.</p>

                    <h2 id="pools">Pool Sections</h2>

                    <p>Several pools offer different temperatures from <strong>96-106°F</strong>. There's a lap swimming area for those who want exercise, an activity pool with a climbing wall for kids, and hot soaking areas for relaxation.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>adults-only infinity-edge pool</strong> is the signature experience. At 106°F with an infinity edge facing the mountains, it's the hottest water and best views. Ages 18+ only, creating a quieter atmosphere for serious relaxation.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>activity pool</strong> includes a climbing wall and is more active and family-oriented. Good for kids who need to burn energy between soaks.</p>

                    <h2 id="value">Great Value</h2>

                    <p>Because it's a municipal pool, prices are reasonable - <strong>around $20 for adults</strong>. That's significantly less than resort hot springs, and you're getting one of the best settings in Colorado. It's a community facility first, tourist destination second, which keeps the vibe authentic.</p>

                    <h2 id="ouray">Visiting Ouray</h2>

                    <p>Ouray is <strong>America's ice climbing capital</strong>. The Ouray Ice Park offers beginner to expert routes, and hot springs après-climb is tradition. Even if you don't climb, watching the frozen waterfalls is impressive.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>Million Dollar Highway (US-550)</strong> runs through town as part of the San Juan Skyway. It's one of America's most dramatic drives, but can be snowy and intense in winter.</p>

                    <p>Downtown Ouray has <strong>Victorian mining-era architecture</strong>, a walkable main street, restaurants, shops, and galleries. It's a genuine mountain town that hasn't lost its soul to tourism.</p>

                    <p>Lodging is limited - <strong>historic hotels and B&Bs</strong> with few rooms. Book ahead, especially in winter. The Wiesbaden Hot Springs resort offers private vapor caves for a different soaking experience.</p>
