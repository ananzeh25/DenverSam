                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> 7 miles north of Steamboat Springs. <strong>What makes it special:</strong> Natural stone pools in wilderness setting, clothing-optional after dark. <strong>Important:</strong> 4WD required in winter, cash only, reservations required.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Strawberry Park Hot Springs offers something different from Colorado's resort-style hot springs. Here, natural rock pools are built into the hillside along Hot Springs Creek. The setting is forested and wild. Facilities are rustic. The vibe is decidedly earthy and countercultural.</p>

                    <p>Located about 7 miles north of Steamboat Springs, Strawberry Park has been operating since 1982. The springs bubble up at 147°F and are cooled by creek water to soaking temperatures ranging from 101-106°F depending on which pool you choose and how much cold water is flowing.</p>

                    <p>This is Colorado's most authentic wilderness hot springs experience. No fancy pools, no resort amenities - just natural stone, forest, and hot water bubbling from the earth.</p>

                    <h2 id="clothing-optional">Clothing-Optional After Dark</h2>

                    <p>The experience is <strong>clothing-optional after dark</strong>, which has cemented Strawberry Park's reputation as a free-spirited alternative to more commercial springs. Daytime visits are family-friendly with suits required. Either way, you're soaking in a genuine mountain setting that feels worlds away from resort pools.</p>

                    <p><strong>Adults only (18+) after dark.</strong> Know before you go - if you're not comfortable with the clothing-optional scene, visit during the day.</p>

                    <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There</h2>

                    <p>The winter road is steep and unpaved. <strong>4WD or chains are mandatory</strong> - they will turn you away without them. Don't risk it in a 2WD rental car; you'll get stuck or slide off the road.</p>

                    <p><strong>Shuttle service</strong> runs from Steamboat Springs regularly during operating hours. If you don't have 4WD, this is the way to go. It's actually nice - no white-knuckling the road, and you can drink a beer at the springs without worrying about the drive down.</p>

                    <h2 id="planning">Planning Your Visit</h2>

                    <p><strong>Reservations required</strong>, especially on weekends. Book online in advance. Limited capacity keeps it from feeling crowded, which is part of the appeal.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cash only.</strong> No credit cards accepted anywhere on site. Bring cash for admission. There's an ATM in Steamboat but not at the springs.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rustic cabins and covered wagons</strong> are available for overnight stays. Waking up and soaking before anyone else arrives is magical. Very limited availability - book months ahead for winter weekends.</p>

                    <h2 id="apres-ski">After Skiing</h2>

                    <p>Strawberry Park is the perfect après-ski from Steamboat Resort. Night soaking under stars after a ski day is magical. Take the shuttle so you can relax fully without worrying about the drive.</p>
