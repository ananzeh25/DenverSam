                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Downtown Glenwood Springs, 2.5 hours from Denver on I-70. <strong>Pool temps:</strong> Main pool 90-93°F, therapy pool 104°F. <strong>Price:</strong> Adults ~$30, kids less. Open daily year-round.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Glenwood Hot Springs Pool has been drawing visitors since 1888, and it remains Colorado's most famous hot springs destination. The main pool stretches over two blocks - more than a football field in length - making it the world's largest hot springs pool. Over 3.5 million gallons of naturally heated mineral water fill the pools daily.</p>

                    <p>The resort sits in the heart of downtown Glenwood Springs, an easy 2.5-hour drive from Denver on I-70. The location makes it perfect for a day trip or as part of a longer mountain vacation. Many visitors combine a soak with skiing at nearby Sunlight or Aspen resorts.</p>

                    <p>Winter is magical here. Steam rises from the enormous pool against a backdrop of snow-covered cliffs. The water stays at a comfortable 90-93°F in the big pool and 104°F in the therapy pool. You can swim laps, float lazily, or simply sit in the hot water watching snowflakes melt on contact.</p>

                    <h2 id="pools">The Pools</h2>

                    <p>The <strong>main pool</strong> is 405 feet long and holds over a million gallons. It's kept at 90-93°F - warm enough to be comfortable, cool enough to actually swim. This isn't just a soaking pool; people swim laps, play with kids, and spread out. Even on busy days, the sheer size means you can find space.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>therapy pool</strong> runs hotter at 104°F and is for serious soaking. It's smaller and shallower, designed for sitting and relaxing rather than swimming. After skiing or hiking, this is where your muscles will thank you.</p>

                    <p>Two <strong>water slides</strong> add fun for families. They require an additional fee and plunge you back into warm water at the bottom - a particular thrill in winter.</p>

                    <h2 id="visiting">Planning Your Visit</h2>

                    <p><strong>Weekday mornings</strong> are quietest. Weekend afternoons can get crowded, especially in summer. Winter holidays pack the pool. If you want space, arrive when the doors open.</p>

                    <p><strong>Evening soaks</strong> are atmospheric - the pool stays open until 9 or 10 PM depending on season, and there's something special about soaking under stars with steam rising around you.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bring flip-flops</strong> for the deck and a waterproof phone case if you want photos. Towels and lockers are available for rent. Swimsuit required - this isn't a clothing-optional facility.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>Glenwood Hot Springs Lodge</strong> offers poolside rooms with unlimited pool access included. Walking from your room to the water in a robe is pretty great, especially in winter.</p>

                    <h2 id="after-skiing">Après-Ski Destination</h2>

                    <p>Glenwood is perfectly positioned for ski resort access. <strong>Sunlight Mountain</strong> is just 10 minutes away - a small, affordable ski area that's great for families. <strong>Aspen</strong> resorts are 45 minutes up the valley for more serious skiing.</p>

                    <p>The tradition of skiing all day then soaking in hot springs is one of Colorado's best combinations. Your body will feel the difference, and the contrast of cold mountain air and hot mineral water is deeply satisfying.</p>

                    <h2 id="food">Dining Options</h2>

                    <p>An <strong>on-site grill</strong> serves food poolside if you don't want to leave. Downtown Glenwood Springs is walkable with many restaurant options - everything from pizza to fine dining. Don't swim on an empty stomach, but don't eat right before either.</p>
