                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>When:</strong> Mid-January each year (dates vary). <strong>Where:</strong> Downtown Breckenridge Main Street. <strong>What:</strong> Week-long celebration honoring Ullr, the Norse god of snow. Parade, bonfire, ice plunge, and wild costumes. <strong>Cost:</strong> Free to attend.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Every January since 1963, Breckenridge has thrown one of Colorado's most unique winter parties. Ullr Fest honors the Norse god of snow and winter - a tongue-in-cheek but surprisingly earnest prayer for powder from the ski-town faithful.</p>

                    <p>The festival started as a simple bonfire where locals burned old ski gear as offerings to Ullr. Over six decades, it's grown into a week of events that blend genuine mountain culture with Viking-themed revelry. It's weird, it's fun, and it's quintessentially Colorado ski town.</p>

                    <p>What makes Ullr Fest special isn't the individual events - it's the vibe. The whole town gets into it. <strong>Viking helmets and ski costumes</strong> fill the streets and bars. Locals who've been coming for decades mix with visitors discovering it for the first time. Everyone's there for the same reason: to celebrate winter.</p>

                    <h2 id="parade">The Ullr Parade</h2>

                    <p>The parade down Main Street is the festival centerpiece. <strong>Floats, costumed marchers, and elaborate Viking-themed entries</strong> wind through downtown while crowds cheer from the sidewalks. It's chaotic and charming - local businesses, ski patrol, random groups of friends who built something ridiculous. Think small-town Fourth of July parade meets Norse mythology meets ski-bum creativity.</p>

                    <p>The best viewing spots fill up early, but the crowd is friendly. Dress warm - you'll be standing in January mountain air for an hour or more. Many spectators wear costumes too, so don't be shy.</p>

                    <h2 id="bonfire">The Ullr Bonfire</h2>

                    <p>The <strong>massive community bonfire</strong> is where old skis, broken gear, and other winter offerings are sacrificed to please Ullr. It's primal and weirdly moving - flames reaching into the cold night sky, crowds gathered around for warmth, the smell of burning wood and old ski wax.</p>

                    <p>There's something ritualistic about it, even as everyone's laughing and drinking hot chocolate (or something stronger). Locals bring gear that served them well, and the burning feels like genuine gratitude mixed with hope for more snow.</p>

                    <h2 id="plunge">The Ullr Ice Plunge</h2>

                    <p>The <strong>ice plunge</strong> is exactly what it sounds like - volunteers jump into freezing water to prove their dedication to winter. You can watch from a safe, dry distance while people in swimsuits (or costumes) take the plunge. It's exhilarating to watch, and surprisingly many people participate.</p>

                    <p>If you're considering it: it's cold. Really cold. But people describe it as life-affirming in a way that only voluntary suffering can be.</p>

                    <h2 id="planning">Planning Your Visit</h2>

                    <p><strong>Accommodation books up</strong> for Ullr Fest weekend. The town is small and the festival draws visitors from across Colorado. Book early if you want to stay in Breckenridge proper.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bars stay busy</strong> all week with costume contests, live music, and après-ski specials. The nightlife scene peaks during Ullr Fest - if you want to experience Breckenridge's party side, this is the week.</p>

                    <p>During the day, <strong>ski like normal</strong>. Breckenridge Resort operates as usual, and skiing during Ullr Fest is a tradition. The festival events happen in the afternoon and evening, so mornings belong to the mountain.</p>
