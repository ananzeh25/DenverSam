                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Skill required:</strong> If you can walk, you can snowshoe. <strong>Rental cost:</strong> $15-25/day at outdoor shops. <strong>Best spots:</strong> Rocky Mountain National Park, Golden Gate Canyon, Breckenridge, Vail. <strong>What to wear:</strong> Waterproof boots, layers, gaiters recommended.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Snowshoeing is the easiest way to explore Colorado's winter backcountry. Strap on a pair of snowshoes and suddenly you can walk on top of deep snow, accessing quiet forest trails, frozen meadows, and mountain vistas that few visitors ever see.</p>

                    <p>If you can walk, you can snowshoe. There's no technique to learn, no lessons required. The snowshoes distribute your weight so you float on top of the snow instead of sinking knee-deep. Poles help with balance on hills but aren't essential for flat terrain.</p>

                    <p>The experience is different from skiing - <strong>slower, quieter, more contemplative</strong>. You'll hear birds and wind, spot animal tracks, find solitude even on busy winter weekends. Many people find it meditative, a chance to truly experience mountain winter without the noise and crowds of ski resorts.</p>

                    <h2 id="rmnp">Rocky Mountain National Park</h2>

                    <p><strong>Rocky Mountain National Park</strong> offers some of Colorado's best snowshoeing, and the park runs <strong>free ranger-led snowshoe walks</strong> throughout winter. Rangers provide snowshoes and lead groups on 2-mile loops, teaching about winter ecology, animal behavior, and the snowy landscape. Reservations fill up fast - book through recreation.gov.</p>

                    <p>The Bear Lake area has groomed trails and spectacular views. Even without a ranger program, you can rent snowshoes in Estes Park and explore independently. The frozen lakes, snow-covered peaks, and wildlife make this a bucket-list destination.</p>

                    <h2 id="golden-gate">Golden Gate Canyon</h2>

                    <p><strong>Golden Gate Canyon State Park</strong> is the easiest snowshoeing from Denver - about 45 minutes from the city. Over 35 miles of trails wind through pine forests with mountain views. This is where Front Range locals go when they want to snowshoe without driving to the high mountains.</p>

                    <p>The park has trails for all abilities, from flat meadow loops to challenging ridge hikes. A state park pass is required. Snowshoe rentals available in Golden.</p>

                    <h2 id="breckenridge">Breckenridge & Summit County</h2>

                    <p><strong>Breckenridge Nordic Center</strong> maintains groomed snowshoe trails through scenic forest. For more adventure, numerous national forest trails leave from town. Guided moonlight tours add atmosphere - snowshoeing through dark forest with only headlamps and stars.</p>

                    <p>Equipment rentals are available on Main Street and at the Nordic Center. The combination of ski-town amenities and backcountry access makes this a good choice for mixed groups where some ski and others snowshoe.</p>

                    <h2 id="vail">Vail Area</h2>

                    <p><strong>Walking Mountains Science Center</strong> in Vail offers guided naturalist snowshoe tours. Rangers teach about wildlife, winter ecology, and mountain ecosystems while leading you through aspen groves and forest trails. It's educational and scenic.</p>

                    <p>Vail's extensive trail network offers independent options too. The terrain varies from flat valley floors to challenging backcountry. Rental shops throughout Vail Village have gear.</p>

                    <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

                    <p><strong>Rent snowshoes</strong> at outdoor shops in mountain towns or REI stores in Denver. About $15-25 per day. Modern snowshoes are lightweight and easy to use - just strap them over your boots and go. Poles are optional but helpful on hills.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wear waterproof boots</strong> - you'll be walking through snow. Hiking boots work if they're waterproof. Gaiters keep snow from falling into your boots. Dress in layers - you'll warm up fast from the walking.</p>

                    <p><strong>Start on groomed or marked trails.</strong> While snowshoeing opens up the backcountry, beginners should stick to established routes. Breaking trail through deep powder is exhausting, and navigation in winter can be tricky.</p>

                    <h2 id="safety">Safety Considerations</h2>

                    <p><strong>Know avalanche terrain.</strong> Colorado's mountains have avalanche danger, and snowshoers can trigger slides in steep terrain. If you're venturing into backcountry beyond marked trails, take an avalanche course and carry proper gear.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tell someone your plans.</strong> Winter conditions change fast. Leave your itinerary with someone and stick to it. Carry water, snacks, and extra layers - getting stranded in cold weather is serious.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stay on marked trails</strong> unless you have backcountry experience. It's easy to get disoriented when everything is covered in snow. What looks like a shortcut might be a cliff edge or unstable terrain.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is snowshoeing hard?</h4>
                            <p>No - if you can walk, you can snowshoe. The only adjustment is slightly wider steps to avoid stepping on your own snowshoes. Most people feel comfortable within minutes.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I use hiking boots?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, as long as they're waterproof. Snowshoes strap over whatever boots you're wearing. Insulated, waterproof hiking boots work well.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How far can I go?</h4>
                            <p>Distances vary by fitness and terrain. Beginners often do 2-4 miles. Experienced snowshoers cover 8+ miles on long day trips. It's slower than summer hiking - plan accordingly.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Do I need poles?</h4>
                            <p>Not required on flat terrain, but helpful on hills for balance. If you have trekking poles from hiking, bring them. Some rental shops include poles.</p>
