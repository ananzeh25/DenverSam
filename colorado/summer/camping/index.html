                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Season:</strong> May through September (varies by elevation). <strong>Options:</strong> Developed campgrounds, dispersed camping, state parks, RV parks. <strong>Reservations:</strong> Recreation.gov for USFS/NPS, CPW for state parks. <strong>Key tip:</strong> Popular sites book months ahead - plan early.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Colorado offers camping experiences ranging from full-service RV parks to primitive backcountry sites where you won't see another soul. The state has hundreds of developed campgrounds in national forests, state parks, and national parks, plus millions of acres where dispersed camping is free and legal.</p>

                    <p>The challenge is access - <strong>popular campgrounds fill months in advance</strong>, especially near Rocky Mountain National Park and major trailheads. Planning ahead is essential for summer weekends. But with flexibility, you can almost always find a spot somewhere in Colorado's vast public lands.</p>

                    <h2 id="types">Types of Camping</h2>

                    <p><strong>Developed campgrounds</strong> offer designated sites with fire rings, picnic tables, and vault or flush toilets. Many have potable water. Reserve via Recreation.gov for USFS and NPS sites. These fill fast - book as soon as reservations open, typically 6 months ahead.</p>

                    <p><strong>Dispersed camping</strong> is free on most national forest land. Find your own spot off a forest road, bring everything you need (including water), and follow Leave No Trace principles. There's a 14-day limit at any one location. This is how locals camp when campgrounds are full.</p>

                    <p><strong>State park campgrounds</strong> are well-maintained with good amenities. Reserve through CPW (Colorado Parks & Wildlife). You'll pay a camping fee plus a daily vehicle fee. Quality is consistently high.</p>

                    <h2 id="destinations">Top Camping Destinations</h2>

                    <p><strong>Rocky Mountain National Park</strong> has five campgrounds - all require reservations released months ahead. Competition is fierce. Backcountry permits allow wilderness camping for those willing to hike in.</p>

                    <p><strong>Maroon Bells area</strong> near Aspen offers stunning scenery at developed campgrounds. Reserve early. Some first-come, first-served sites available if you arrive midweek and early.</p>

                    <p><strong>Turquoise Lake</strong> near Leadville sits at 9,900 feet with multiple campgrounds around a beautiful reservoir. The elevation keeps it cool even in August - bring warm sleeping bags.</p>

                    <p><strong>Great Sand Dunes</strong> puts you at the base of North America's tallest dunes. Piñon Flats Campground is small and books quickly. The landscape is unlike anywhere else in Colorado.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Camping Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>High-elevation camping stays cool</strong> - nighttime temps drop into the 40s even in summer. Bring layers and a warm sleeping bag rated for cold nights.</p>

                    <p><strong>Store food properly.</strong> Bear-resistant containers or vehicle storage is required in many areas. Even where not required, it's wise. Bears and other wildlife are active and food-motivated.</p>

                    <p><strong>Be ready for storms.</strong> Afternoon thunderstorms build almost daily in July and August. Secure your camp before heading out for the day. Never shelter under lone trees during lightning.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I camp anywhere in national forests?</h4>
                            <p>Generally yes for dispersed camping, but check specific restrictions. Some areas near water or popular trailheads prohibit dispersed camping. Motor vehicle use maps show where you can drive.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What about fire restrictions?</h4>
                            <p>Fire bans are common in dry summers. Check current restrictions before your trip. Bring a camp stove as backup - fires may be prohibited even in established fire rings.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How do I find dispersed camping spots?</h4>
                            <p>Look for established pullouts along forest roads. Apps like iOverlander and FreeRoam show user-reported sites. Arrive early for best selection - popular areas fill by Friday afternoon.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is camping in Colorado safe?</h4>
                            <p>Yes - wildlife concerns are manageable with proper food storage. The bigger risks are weather-related: lightning, hypothermia from sudden temperature drops, and altitude sickness if you're not acclimated.</p>
