                    <p>Telluride sits in a box canyon surrounded by 13,000-foot peaks, and somehow this remote mountain town has become one of America's premier festival destinations. From late spring through early fall, world-class music, film, and cultural events transform the historic mining town.</p>

                    <p>The setting is unmatched. <strong>Town Park, the main festival venue, sits with waterfalls cascading down the mountains behind the stage.</strong> The free gondola connects to Mountain Village above. The combination of intimate town, spectacular nature, and world-class programming creates magic that brings people back year after year.</p>

                    <h2 id="bluegrass">Bluegrass Festival</h2>

                    <p><strong>The original Telluride festival since 1974</strong> - four days in late June that define the summer. Legendary performances and spontaneous jam sessions continue through the night. Town Park camping creates a community of returning faithful who know each other across decades.</p>

                    <p>The Bluegrass Festival has launched careers and featured the genre's greatest names. It's equal parts musical pilgrimage and summer reunion for the bluegrass community. Passes sell out almost immediately when they go on sale.</p>

                    <h2 id="jazz">Jazz Festival</h2>

                    <p><strong>Three days in early August</strong> with intimate performances by jazz legends. Multiple venues host shows, including free concerts in Town Park. The vibe is smaller and more refined than Bluegrass - a chance to see world-class musicians in a stunning setting.</p>

                    <h2 id="film">Film Festival</h2>

                    <p><strong>Four days over Labor Day weekend</strong> featuring premieres, documentaries, and filmmaker tributes. Star sightings happen naturally as celebrities stroll the same streets as everyone else. The Telluride Film Festival has become a major stop on the awards-season circuit - movies that premiere here often go on to Oscar nominations.</p>

                    <h2 id="mushroom">Mushroom Festival</h2>

                    <p><strong>A unique August weekend</strong> celebrating fungi. Expert-led foraging walks take participants into the forests around Telluride. Cooking demonstrations, lectures, and discussions attract mycology enthusiasts from around the world. It's exactly as quirky and wonderful as it sounds.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Festival Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Book early.</strong> Lodging sells out months in advance - Telluride has only about 400 hotel rooms. Festival passes often sell out too. Plan 6+ months ahead for major events. Last-minute is nearly impossible.</p>

                    <p><strong>Consider camping.</strong> Town Park camping is part of the Bluegrass experience and far more affordable than hotels. Bring warm gear - nights get cold at 8,750 feet even in summer.</p>

                    <p><strong>Respect the altitude.</strong> Drink water, take it easy the first day. Alcohol hits harder up here. Give yourself time to acclimate before dancing all night.</p>
