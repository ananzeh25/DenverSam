                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Must-drive routes:</strong> Trail Ridge Road, Independence Pass, Million Dollar Highway, Peak to Peak. <strong>Season:</strong> Late May through October (varies by route). <strong>Elevations:</strong> 12,000+ feet on highest passes. <strong>Key tip:</strong> Start early to avoid afternoon thunderstorms.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Summer unlocks Colorado's most spectacular scenic drives. Passes that remain closed under feet of snow all winter finally open, revealing alpine landscapes accessible only by car a few months each year. These roads offer some of the most dramatic scenery in North America.</p>

                    <p><strong>Trail Ridge Road through Rocky Mountain National Park crests at 12,183 feet</strong> - the highest continuous paved road in the U.S. Independence Pass east of Aspen reaches 12,095 feet with dizzying switchbacks. The Million Dollar Highway between Silverton and Ouray offers cliffside drama that makes passengers grip their armrests.</p>

                    <h2 id="trail-ridge">Trail Ridge Road</h2>

                    <p><strong>48 miles through Rocky Mountain National Park</strong>, cresting at 12,183 feet. The highest continuous paved road in the United States crosses the Continental Divide with 11 miles above treeline. Alpine tundra, wildflowers, and wildlife viewing opportunities abound. The Alpine Visitor Center at the top provides context and restrooms.</p>

                    <p>Opens late May (weather dependent) and closes mid-October. Expect crowds in summer - consider arriving early or visiting on weekdays. The drive takes 2-3 hours without stops, but you'll want to stop often.</p>

                    <h2 id="independence">Independence Pass</h2>

                    <p><strong>Connects Aspen to Leadville over 12,095 feet</strong> with dramatic switchbacks, alpine lakes, and ghost town remains. The narrow road with steep drop-offs isn't for nervous drivers, but the scenery rewards the brave. Opens Memorial Day and closes when snow makes it impassable, typically in October.</p>

                    <h2 id="million-dollar">Million Dollar Highway</h2>

                    <p><strong>US 550 between Silverton and Ouray</strong> - 25 miles of jaw-dropping cliffs, mining history, and three mountain passes. The name might come from the gold in the roadbed, or the cost to build it, or what your life is worth as you navigate hairpin turns above sheer drops. Not for the faint of heart, but unforgettable.</p>

                    <h2 id="peak-to-peak">Peak to Peak Highway</h2>

                    <p><strong>Easier access from Boulder</strong> through mountain towns to Estes Park. Open year-round, this route offers beautiful scenery without the extreme elevations or white-knuckle drops of the high passes. A good introduction to Colorado mountain driving.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Driving Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Start early.</strong> Beat crowds and afternoon thunderstorms. Popular roads pack up by midday on weekends. Morning light is best for photography anyway.</p>

                    <p><strong>Check brakes and watch temperature.</strong> Long descents require engine braking - use low gear. Your brakes can overheat on continuous downhill. Most rental cars handle fine; just drive smart.</p>

                    <p><strong>Altitude affects you.</strong> At 12,000+ feet, you may feel lightheaded. Stay hydrated, don't overexert on short walks. Take it easy if you're not acclimated.</p>

                            <h4>When do passes open and close?</h4>
                            <p>Most high passes open late May to early June and close October or when snow makes them impassable. Check current status before going - opening dates vary by year.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can any car handle these roads?</h4>
                            <p>Paved scenic drives are passable in any vehicle. Steep grades and switchbacks require attention but don't require 4WD. Some unpaved passes do require high clearance or 4WD.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Are these drives scary?</h4>
                            <p>Independence Pass and Million Dollar Highway have steep drop-offs that make some people uncomfortable. Trail Ridge and Peak to Peak are more gentle. Know your comfort level.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How much time should I allow?</h4>
                            <p>These drives take longer than mileage suggests - you'll stop often for views and photos. Allow 3-4 hours for Trail Ridge, 2-3 for Independence Pass. Don't rush.</p>
