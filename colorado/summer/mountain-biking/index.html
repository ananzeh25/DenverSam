                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Season:</strong> June through September (lower elevations earlier). <strong>Top destinations:</strong> Fruita, Trestle Bike Park, Crested Butte, Breckenridge. <strong>Terrain:</strong> Desert slickrock to alpine singletrack. <strong>Key tip:</strong> Start early to avoid afternoon thunderstorms.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Colorado mountain biking is legendary. The state offers every type of terrain - desert slickrock in Fruita, high-alpine singletrack in Breckenridge, flowy trails in Winter Park, and technical challenges everywhere. IMBA has designated more Epic Rides here than any other state.</p>

                    <p>Summer transforms ski resorts into lift-served bike parks. <strong>Winter Park's Trestle Bike Park is one of the country's largest</strong> - ride the lift up, bomb down purpose-built trails, repeat. No climbing required. Keystone, Snowmass, and others offer similar experiences. Cross-country riders have endless options including the 567-mile Colorado Trail from Denver to Durango.</p>

                    <h2 id="destinations">Top Destinations</h2>

                    <p><strong>Fruita</strong> near Grand Junction offers desert riding that's accessible nearly year-round. Kokopelli's Trail, 18 Road, and Horsethief Bench deliver slickrock and buff singletrack. When mountain trails are still snowbound, Fruita is already dry and fast.</p>

                    <p><strong>Trestle Bike Park</strong> at Winter Park features 40+ miles of lift-served trails from beginner to pro. Jumps, berms, and natural features cater to every skill level. Rentals available if you don't want to haul your own bike.</p>

                    <p><strong>Crested Butte</strong> claims to be the birthplace of mountain biking, and the 401 Trail is a bucket-list ride for good reason. The terrain is technical, beautiful, and challenging - classic Colorado high-country riding.</p>

                    <p><strong>Breckenridge</strong> offers high-altitude riding with stunning views. Colorado Trail access, family-friendly paths, and expert-only descents coexist in a compact area. The bike park and natural trails provide variety for any ability.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Riding Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Altitude matters.</strong> Many trails start above 9,000 feet. Expect reduced performance if visiting from sea level. Hydrate heavily, and start with easier rides until you acclimate.</p>

                    <p><strong>Start early.</strong> Afternoon thunderstorms are common in summer mountains. Hit the trail by 8 AM, aim to finish by 1 PM. Lightning is a real danger at altitude - getting caught in a storm above treeline is serious.</p>

                    <p><strong>Yield appropriately.</strong> Hikers and horses have right of way. Downhill yields to uphill. Stay on marked trails, close gates, and pack out what you pack in. Colorado's trails stay beautiful because riders respect them.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I rent bikes?</h4>
                            <p>Yes - shops in every mountain town offer rentals from basic hardtails to high-end full suspension. Bike parks typically have demo fleets. Reserve ahead on busy weekends.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>When do trails open?</h4>
                            <p>Lower elevation trails (Fruita, Front Range) open early spring. High-altitude trails typically clear of snow by mid-June to early July, depending on the year's snowpack.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Are bike parks worth it?</h4>
                            <p>If you want to log vertical feet without climbing, absolutely. The lift access lets you ride far more downhill in a day than pedaling. Great for progression and pure fun.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What about e-bikes?</h4>
                            <p>Rules vary by land manager and trail system. Many wilderness areas and some trail systems prohibit e-bikes. Bike parks generally welcome them. Check before you ride.</p>
