                    <p>The iconic <strong>Colfax Avenue Pride Parade</strong> kicks off Sunday morning, featuring colorful floats, marching bands, community organizations, and corporate sponsors winding through Capitol Hill. The energy is electric as crowds line the streets cheering, waving flags, and celebrating visibility.</p>

                    <h2 id="parade">The Parade</h2>

                    <p><strong>Sunday morning down Colfax Avenue</strong> through Capitol Hill - this is the heart of Pride weekend. The route passes through Denver's historically LGBTQ+ neighborhood, adding significance to the celebration. Floats range from corporate sponsors to grassroots community groups, all celebrating together.</p>

                    <p>Arrive early for good viewing spots along the route. The parade draws huge crowds, and the energy builds as floats pass by. Expect color, music, celebration, and moments of genuine emotion as the community marches in visibility.</p>

                    <h2 id="festival">The Festival</h2>

                    <p><strong>Civic Center Park</strong> hosts the main festival with multiple stages of live music, drag performances, DJs, and special guests. National acts and local performers share the lineup. Food vendors, exhibitors, and community organizations fill the grounds.</p>

                    <p>Admission to the main festival area is free. The atmosphere celebrates LGBTQ+ pride while raising awareness for ongoing civil rights issues. Related events, parties, brunches, and activities happen throughout Denver during the entire Pride Week - check local listings for the full schedule.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Attending Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Plan transportation.</strong> Civic Center is served by light rail - easier than finding parking downtown. Rideshare surge pricing is common during the festival. Walking from nearby neighborhoods works well.</p>
