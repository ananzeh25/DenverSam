                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>What:</strong> Four blocks of pedestrian-only shopping, dining, and entertainment. <strong>Where:</strong> 11th to 15th Streets in downtown Boulder. <strong>Best for:</strong> People-watching, dining, shopping, street performers. Open 24/7, most shops 10am-9pm.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Pearl Street Mall is Boulder in concentrated form. This four-block pedestrian zone is where the city comes to eat, drink, shop, and watch each other do the same. On any given evening, you'll find families with kids, college students, tourists, street performers, and the occasional guy juggling chainsaws - all sharing the same brick-paved stretch of downtown.</p>

                    <p>The mall was created in 1977 when Boulder closed four blocks of Pearl Street to cars. What could have been a failed urban experiment became the city's defining public space. The secret is the mix: local boutiques next to chain stores, fine dining beside casual spots, historic buildings alongside modern ones. It works because it feels organic rather than manufactured.</p>

                    <h2 id="restaurants">Where to Eat</h2>

                    <p><strong>The Kitchen</strong> pioneered Boulder's farm-to-table movement and remains a flagship. The upstairs bar has better availability than the main dining room, and the community table is perfect for solo diners. Expect locally sourced everything and prices to match.</p>

                    <p><strong>Salt</strong> serves modern American in a sleek space with a boulder-view patio. The cocktail program is strong, and the late-night happy hour draws a sophisticated crowd. Good for a date or impressing out-of-town guests.</p>

                    <p><strong>Brasserie Ten Ten</strong> brings French bistro classics to Pearl Street. The steak frites and moules are reliable, and the wine list goes deep. The heated patio extends the outdoor dining season well into fall.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Sink</strong> is Boulder's legendary dive, serving students since 1923. The pizza is greasy, the burgers are massive, and the walls are covered in decades of graffiti. Robert Redford worked here as a janitor. It's not fancy, but it's essential Boulder.</p>

                    <h2 id="bars">Drinks and Nightlife</h2>

                    <p><strong>License No. 1</strong> occupies the basement space that held Boulder's first liquor license post-Prohibition. The cocktails are craft, the vibe is speakeasy, and the low ceilings create an intimate atmosphere. Reservations recommended on weekends.</p>

                    <p><strong>Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery</strong> is Boulder's beloved brewpub, serving house-made beers since 1993. No TVs, no hard liquor, cash only - and packed every night. The Colorado Kind Ale is a local icon.</p>

                    <p><strong>West End Tavern</strong> has the rooftop patio you want on summer evenings. Views of the Flatirons, solid beer selection, and bar food that exceeds expectations. Get there early for a rooftop table.</p>

                    <h2 id="shopping">Shopping Highlights</h2>

                    <p>The mall mixes national chains with independent boutiques. The local shops are what make it interesting - you can find chains anywhere, but Boulder's independents reflect the city's character.</p>

                    <p><strong>Into the Wind</strong> sells kites, windspinners, and other things that fly. It's been a Pearl Street fixture since 1977 and remains genuinely delightful. Good luck leaving without buying something.</p>

                    <p><strong>Art Mart</strong> stocks gifts and home goods with a distinctly Boulder sensibility. Local artists, clever designs, and the kind of stuff you actually want to give people.</p>

                    <p><strong>Boulder Book Store</strong> is one of the best independent bookstores in the region. Three floors of books, a strong local section, and regular author events. The travel section is especially good for planning Colorado adventures.</p>

                    <h2 id="performers">Street Performers</h2>

                    <p>Pearl Street's street performers are part of the experience. On summer evenings, you might catch acrobats, musicians, magicians, or the legendary Zip Code Man (ask him about any zip code in America). The quality varies, but watching is free and the entertainment value is real.</p>

                    <p>The best performers stake out spots near the 13th Street intersection, where foot traffic is heaviest. Summer weekends bring the biggest crowds and the most elaborate acts. Tip generously if you stop to watch - these folks work for tips.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Visitor Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Parking is challenging.</strong> The parking structures on 11th and 15th Streets are your best bet. Street parking on side streets is free but time-limited and hard to find. The HOP bus is free and stops nearby.</p>

                    <p><strong>Walk beyond the four blocks.</strong> Pearl Street extends east and west of the pedestrian zone with additional restaurants and shops. The blocks around 9th and 10th have some excellent spots without the mall crowds.</p>

                    <p><strong>Evenings are best for atmosphere.</strong> The mall transforms after dark, especially on warm weekends. String lights glow, restaurants fill their patios, and the energy shifts from shopping to socializing.</p>
