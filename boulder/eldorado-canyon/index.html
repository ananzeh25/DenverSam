                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> 10 miles south of Boulder. <strong>Known for:</strong> World-class rock climbing, dramatic canyon scenery, hiking trails, swimming hole. <strong>Entrance fee:</strong> State park pass required. Open year-round, dawn to dusk.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Eldorado Canyon is one of the most famous climbing destinations in America, but you don't have to climb to appreciate it. The dramatic canyon, with 850-foot quartzite walls rising above South Boulder Creek, offers hiking, picnicking, and some of the best people-watching in Colorado - where the "people" are often climbers ascending vertical walls in impressive displays of skill.</p>

                    <p>The state park sits just 10 miles south of Boulder, making it an easy day trip or half-day outing. The walls catch climbers from around the world, while the trails attract hikers, and the creek provides summer swimming relief. Even a casual drive through the canyon delivers dramatic scenery.</p>

                    <h2 id="climbing">Rock Climbing</h2>

                    <p>Eldorado is hallowed ground for climbers. Routes like the Naked Edge, Ruper, and the Bastille are legendary, drawing technical climbers from around the world. The climbing style tends toward traditional - placing your own protection rather than clipping bolts - and the grades are famously stiff.</p>

                    <p>The main walls include <strong>The Bastille</strong> (the prominent formation visible from the road), <strong>Redgarden Wall</strong> (home to the Naked Edge), and <strong>Rincon Wall</strong>. Together they offer hundreds of routes from moderate to extremely difficult.</p>

                    <p>This is not beginner climbing. The routes are exposed, the protection often sparse, and the consequences of mistakes serious. If you're not already a competent trad climber, don't attempt Eldo's classic routes without a guide or very experienced partners.</p>

                    <p>Even non-climbers can appreciate the spectacle. From various viewpoints in the park, you can watch climbers on the walls - tiny figures ascending what looks like impossibly steep rock. Bring binoculars and it becomes genuinely compelling viewing.</p>

                    <h2 id="hiking">Hiking Trails</h2>

                    <p><strong>Fowler Trail</strong> is the most accessible hike, running 0.8 miles from the visitor center along the base of the canyon walls. It's paved and relatively flat, suitable for all abilities. Views of the cliffs and creek are excellent, and you'll likely see climbers above.</p>

                    <p><strong>Eldorado Canyon Trail</strong> is longer and more challenging, climbing 4.5 miles to the top of the canyon with significant elevation gain. The views from the ridge are spectacular - you can see Denver in one direction and the Continental Divide in the other. Budget 3-4 hours for the round trip.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rattlesnake Gulch Trail</strong> leads to the remains of a historic hotel and continues to connecting trails. The round trip to the hotel ruins is about 3 miles with moderate climbing. The historical interest adds dimension beyond pure scenery.</p>

                    <h2 id="swimming">Swimming and Creekside</h2>

                    <p>South Boulder Creek runs through the canyon, and a popular swimming hole near the visitor center draws crowds on hot summer days. The water is cold - fed by snowmelt - but refreshing after a hike. The creek runs fast during spring runoff, when swimming becomes dangerous.</p>

                    <p>Picnic areas along the creek offer pleasant spots for lunch with canyon views. On busy weekends, the most desirable spots fill early. The park allows fishing in designated areas.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Visitor Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>State park pass required.</strong> Colorado Parks passes are available at the entrance, or buy in advance. Annual passes work at all state parks and pay for themselves quickly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Arrive early on weekends.</strong> The parking lot fills by mid-morning on nice summer weekends. Early arrival guarantees a spot; late arrival may mean parking outside the park and walking in.</p>

                    <p><strong>The canyon is narrow.</strong> Summer afternoons get hot, and the walls trap heat. Morning visits are more pleasant for hiking. Climbers tend to follow the shade across the canyon.</p>

                    <p><strong>Watch for rockfall.</strong> The canyon is geologically active, and rockfall occurs. Stay on designated trails and don't linger beneath climbing areas where falling rocks could occur.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can beginners climb at Eldorado Canyon?</h4>
                            <p>Not really without a guide. The climbing is technical and serious. For guided experiences, contact Colorado Mountain School or other certified guide services. Boulder Canyon nearby offers more beginner-friendly routes.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is the swimming hole safe?</h4>
                            <p>During low water (typically July through September), yes. Spring runoff makes the creek dangerous. Always check current conditions and use caution. There are no lifeguards.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How long should I plan for a visit?</h4>
                            <p>A couple hours for the Fowler Trail and swimming hole. Half a day for a longer hike. A full day if you're climbing or want to thoroughly explore.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is Eldorado Canyon open in winter?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, year-round. The canyon can be cold and shaded, but winter hiking is pleasant on clear days. The climbing continues too - south-facing walls catch winter sun.</p>
