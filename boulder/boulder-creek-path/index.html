                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Length:</strong> 16 miles from Boulder Canyon to 55th Street. <strong>Surface:</strong> Paved, well-maintained. <strong>Best for:</strong> Running, biking, walking, tubing (summer). Free to use, open year-round.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Boulder Creek Path is Boulder's central artery for outdoor recreation. This 16-mile paved trail follows Boulder Creek from the foothills through downtown and out to the eastern plains, connecting neighborhoods, parks, and the university along the way. On any given morning, you'll see runners, cyclists, dog walkers, and commuters all sharing the path.</p>

                    <p>What makes the path special is its integration into daily life. This isn't just a weekend recreational trail - it's how Boulderites get around. People bike to work on it, run lunch loops, and walk their kids to school. The path passes through the heart of downtown, crosses the <a href="/boulder/cu-campus/">CU campus</a>, and connects to trailheads throughout the city.</p>

                    <h2 id="sections">Path Sections</h2>

                    <p><strong>Boulder Canyon to Broadway</strong> is the westernmost section, running from the canyon mouth through Eben G. Fine Park and into downtown. This stretch follows the creek closely, with mountain views and the sound of rushing water. The Elephant Buttresses climbing area is visible from the path. It's the most scenic section but also the busiest near downtown.</p>

                    <p><strong>Downtown through CU</strong> takes you past Central Park, the public library, and into the university campus. This is the most urban stretch, with frequent road crossings and the highest foot traffic. The Farmer's Market sets up near the library on Saturdays in season.</p>

                    <p><strong>East Boulder</strong> continues from the university toward 55th Street, passing through quieter residential areas and eventually reaching the plains. This section sees less traffic and offers a more peaceful experience, though the scenery is less dramatic than the western end.</p>

                    <h2 id="activities">What to Do</h2>

                    <p><strong>Running</strong> is the most popular use. The flat, paved surface is ideal for runners of all levels. Popular loops include downtown to Eben G. Fine Park and back (about 4 miles) or the full path for serious training runs. Mile markers help track distance.</p>

                    <p><strong>Biking</strong> works well on the path, though expect to navigate around pedestrians in the busy sections. The path connects to Boulder's extensive bike lane network, making it easy to combine path riding with street routes. Bike rentals are available near <a href="/boulder/pearl-street/">Pearl Street</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tubing</strong> is a summer tradition. From late May through August (depending on water levels), people float down Boulder Creek on inner tubes. Whitewater Tubing Boulder rents tubes and provides shuttle service. The water is cold and the rapids are real - this isn't a lazy river. Wear water shoes and apply sunscreen liberally.</p>

                    <p><strong>Walking</strong> is perfect for casual visitors. The downtown sections offer easy strolling with frequent benches, views of the creek, and access to restaurants and shops along the way. The path is stroller-friendly and accessible.</p>

                    <h2 id="access">Access Points</h2>

                    <p><strong>Eben G. Fine Park</strong> at the west end has parking, picnic areas, and swimming holes. This is the most popular summer hangout spot, with families and sunbathers covering the rocks along the creek.</p>

                    <p><strong>Central Park</strong> in downtown provides easy access from Pearl Street. The library and kids' fishing pond are nearby. This is the busiest access point but the most convenient for visitors.</p>

                    <p><strong>Scott Carpenter Park</strong> east of downtown has a pool, playground, and large parking area. It's a good starting point for longer rides or runs toward east Boulder.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Tips for Visitors</h2>

                    <p><strong>Stay right, pass left.</strong> The path is shared use with heavy traffic. Keep right, announce when passing, and be aware of faster cyclists coming from behind. Basic trail etiquette keeps everyone happy.</p>

                    <p><strong>Morning is best for running and biking.</strong> The path gets crowded on nice afternoons, especially on weekends. Early morning offers cooler temperatures and lighter traffic.</p>

                    <p><strong>Watch for flooding.</strong> Boulder Creek can rise quickly during spring runoff or after heavy rain. Sections of the path flood periodically. Check conditions before planning a full-length ride.</p>

                    <p><strong>The creek is cold.</strong> Fed by snowmelt, Boulder Creek stays chilly even in summer. Tubing is refreshing but expect temperatures in the 50s-60s Fahrenheit.</p>
