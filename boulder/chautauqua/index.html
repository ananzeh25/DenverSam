                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>What:</strong> Historic park and trailhead at the base of the Flatirons. <strong>Where:</strong> 900 Baseline Road, southwest Boulder. <strong>Best for:</strong> Hiking, picnicking, photography, dining at the Chautauqua Dining Hall. Free to visit, open dawn to dusk.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Chautauqua Park is where Boulder meets the mountains. This 40-acre park sits at the base of the <a href="/boulder/flatirons/">Flatirons</a>, serving as the primary trailhead for hikes into the massive rock formations above. But it's more than a parking lot for hikers - the historic cottages, sweeping meadows, and 1898 dining hall make it a destination in its own right.</p>

                    <p>The park is a remnant of the Chautauqua movement, a late-19th-century educational and cultural phenomenon that spread across America. Boulder's Chautauqua opened in 1898, and while the lecture circuits have faded, the cottages, auditorium, and dining hall remain. Today it's a National Historic Landmark and one of the few remaining Chautauqua sites still in continuous operation.</p>

                    <h2 id="trails">Hiking Trails</h2>

                    <p>Most visitors come for the trails. From Chautauqua, you can access dozens of routes ranging from easy meadow strolls to lung-burning climbs. The trail network connects to the broader Boulder Open Space system, offering over 150 miles of possibilities.</p>

                    <p><strong>Chautauqua Trail</strong> is the classic introduction. This 1.5-mile path winds through meadows directly toward the Flatirons, with views improving at every turn. It's wide, well-maintained, and suitable for families with kids. Most people turn around at the intersection with the Mesa Trail, though you can continue on for more challenging terrain.</p>

                    <p><strong>Royal Arch Trail</strong> is Boulder's bucket-list hike. Starting from Chautauqua, the 3.4-mile round trip gains 1,400 feet and ends at a natural stone arch with panoramic views. It's strenuous but achievable for anyone in decent shape. Budget 2-3 hours and bring water.</p>

                    <p><strong>First Flatiron Trail</strong> takes you to the base of the First Flatiron, where you can watch climbers ascending the massive slab. The trail is rougher than Chautauqua Trail, with some scrambling required. From here, non-climbers can continue around the Flatirons via the Flatirons Loop.</p>

                    <p><strong>Enchanted Mesa Loop</strong> offers an easier alternative with similar views. The 2.5-mile loop stays on gentler terrain while still providing classic Flatirons scenery. Good for a morning walk or when you want views without a full workout.</p>

                    <h2 id="dining">Chautauqua Dining Hall</h2>

                    <p>The Chautauqua Dining Hall has been serving meals since 1898, making it one of the oldest restaurants in Colorado. The building is a rustic wooden structure with a wraparound porch and views of the Flatirons that justify the trip on their own.</p>

                    <p><strong>Breakfast</strong> draws crowds on weekends. The menu runs from healthy options (granola, fruit) to indulgent ones (pancakes, eggs benedict). The porch seating fills first, so arrive early or expect a wait.</p>

                    <p><strong>Dinner</strong> is more refined, with a seasonal menu featuring Colorado ingredients. It's a legitimate fine dining experience in a historic setting, though the atmosphere stays casual. Reservations are recommended, especially on summer evenings.</p>

                    <p>Even if you're not eating, the building is worth walking through. The original architecture has been preserved, and the views from the porch are some of the best in Boulder.</p>

                    <h2 id="cottages">Historic Cottages</h2>

                    <p>The 60 historic cottages surrounding the park date from 1898-1930 and can be rented for overnight stays. They range from basic cabins to larger lodges, all within walking distance of the trails. It's a unique way to experience Boulder - waking up at the base of the Flatirons with hiking literally outside your door.</p>

                    <p>The cottages book months in advance for peak summer weekends. Off-season availability is better, and the experience is arguably nicer - fewer crowds on the trails and crisp mountain mornings.</p>

                    <h2 id="parking">Parking Tips</h2>

                    <p>Parking is Chautauqua's biggest challenge. The lot is small, demand is high, and on weekends it fills by 8 AM during peak season. You have several options:</p>

                    <p><strong>Arrive early.</strong> Before 7 AM on summer weekends, before 9 AM on weekdays. This is the most reliable strategy if you want the main lot.</p>

                    <p><strong>Park on nearby streets.</strong> Baseline Road and surrounding residential streets have some parking, though it's time-limited and neighbors aren't thrilled about overflow crowds. Respect the limits and don't block driveways.</p>

                    <p><strong>Use the shuttle.</strong> On peak days, a free shuttle runs from downtown Boulder to Chautauqua. Check the city website for schedules.</p>

                    <p><strong>Walk or bike.</strong> If you're staying in Boulder, the walk from downtown is about 2 miles and mostly uphill - but it's a pleasant warm-up for hiking.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is Chautauqua Park free?</h4>
                            <p>Yes. The park, trails, and parking are all free. The dining hall and cottage rentals cost money, but visiting the grounds doesn't.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What does "Chautauqua" mean?</h4>
                            <p>It refers to a late-1800s adult education movement that originated in Chautauqua, New York. Boulder's site was part of this national network of summer learning communities.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I picnic at Chautauqua?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, the meadows are perfect for picnicking. There are no formal picnic tables, so bring a blanket. The views of the Flatirons from the grass are spectacular.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Are dogs allowed?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, on leash. The trails from Chautauqua into the Open Space require dogs to be leashed. There's no off-leash area within the park.</p>
