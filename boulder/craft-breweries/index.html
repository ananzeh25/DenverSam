                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Scene:</strong> 20+ craft breweries in the Boulder area. <strong>Must-visit:</strong> Avery, Upslope, Mountain Sun. <strong>Style:</strong> Everything from classic IPAs to wild ales and barrel-aged experiments. Many taprooms are dog-friendly with mountain views.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Boulder was craft beer before craft beer was a thing. The Rockies Brewing Company (now Boulder Beer) started here in 1979, becoming one of America's first craft breweries. Today, Boulder punches well above its weight in brewing, with over 20 breweries serving a city of 100,000 people. The beer culture here is serious but unpretentious - you're as likely to see someone in hiking boots as you are a beer geek with a tasting notebook.</p>

                    <p>What makes Boulder's scene distinctive is the integration of brewing into the outdoor lifestyle. Many taprooms have patios with mountain views, and post-hike beers are a genuine tradition. You'll find everything from traditional styles to experimental wild ales, often made by brewers who moved here specifically for the mountains and stayed for the water.</p>

                    <h2 id="essential">Essential Breweries</h2>

                    <p><strong>Avery Brewing Company</strong> is Boulder's biggest and boldest. Their massive facility in Gunbarrel showcases everything from sessionable ales to barrel-aged monsters that age for years. The restaurant serves elevated pub food, and the tap list typically includes 30+ beers including limited releases you won't find anywhere else. Tours are available and worth the time.</p>

                    <p><strong>Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery</strong> is the soul of Boulder beer. Since 1993, this brewpub on Pearl Street has served house-made beers in a no-TV, no-hard-liquor, cash-only environment. The Colorado Kind Ale is legendary, and the vibe is pure Boulder - expect tie-dye, Grateful Dead, and a packed house every night. They also operate Southern Sun and Under the Sun locations around town.</p>

                    <p><strong>Upslope Brewing Company</strong> focuses on quality over variety, making a smaller number of beers extremely well. Their Craft Lager is everywhere in Colorado, and the taprooms in North Boulder and Lee Hill offer laid-back spots to try seasonal releases. The Lee Hill location has excellent Flatirons views from the patio.</p>

                    <p><strong>Sanitas Brewing Company</strong> occupies a beautiful space in North Boulder with a large patio and mountain views. Named after Mount Sanitas (Boulder's popular morning hike), the brewery leans into the outdoor culture with approachable styles and a welcoming atmosphere. Good for groups and families.</p>

                    <h2 id="others">More Worth Visiting</h2>

                    <p><strong>Bootstrap Brewing</strong> makes hop-forward beers in a no-frills Niwot taproom. The Insane Rush IPA built their reputation, and they've expanded into a range of styles without losing focus on quality.</p>

                    <p><strong>Finkel & Garf</strong> operates a small taproom near <a href="/boulder/pearl-street/">Pearl Street</a> with a constantly rotating selection of house beers. It's intimate and casual, perfect for a quick pint while exploring downtown.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wild Provisions Beer Project</strong> specializes in farmhouse ales and wild fermentation. It's more experimental than most Boulder breweries, with complex, funky flavors that reward adventurous drinkers.</p>

                    <p><strong>Twisted Pine</strong> has been brewing in Boulder since 1995, offering a solid lineup of classics alongside creative seasonal releases. The downtown taproom is a good option when Pearl Street crowds overwhelm smaller spots.</p>

                    <h2 id="tours">Brewery Hopping</h2>

                    <p>Boulder's compact size makes brewery hopping easy. Several clusters of taprooms allow you to visit multiple spots without driving:</p>

                    <p><strong>Downtown/Pearl Street</strong> has Mountain Sun, Finkel & Garf, and Twisted Pine within walking distance. Combine with dinner and you've got an evening.</p>

                    <p><strong>North Boulder</strong> clusters Sanitas, Upslope (Flatiron location), and several others along Broadway and nearby streets. This area has more parking and a slightly more local feel than downtown.</p>

                    <p><strong>Gunbarrel/East Boulder</strong> requires driving but offers Avery's production facility and tasting room, worth the trip for serious beer enthusiasts.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Tips for Visitors</h2>

                    <p><strong>Altitude affects alcohol.</strong> At 5,400 feet, you'll feel beer faster than at sea level. Pace yourself, especially if you're visiting multiple breweries. The locals know this - that's why flights are popular.</p>

                    <p><strong>Most taprooms are dog-friendly.</strong> Boulder's outdoor patios welcome well-behaved dogs, making brewery visits easy to combine with hiking or trail time.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cash helps at Mountain Sun.</strong> They're famously cash-only, though ATMs are nearby. Other breweries take cards.</p>

                    <p><strong>Weekday afternoons are best.</strong> Weekends get crowded, especially at popular spots. Midweek visits mean easier seating and more attention from bartenders.</p>
