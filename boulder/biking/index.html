                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Reputation:</strong> One of America's top cycling cities. <strong>Road:</strong> Flagstaff, Lefthand Canyon, Peak-to-Peak. <strong>Mountain:</strong> Marshall Mesa, Betasso, Walker Ranch. <strong>Paths:</strong> 300+ miles of bike lanes and multi-use paths.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Boulder is a cycling city. Not in an aspirational way - in a real, practical, everyday way. People bike to work, bike to the store, bike to the trailhead where they'll go hiking. The infrastructure supports it, the culture encourages it, and the terrain ranges from gentle paths to brutal mountain climbs. Professional cyclists train here for good reason.</p>

                    <p>For visitors, Boulder offers everything from casual path riding to epic road climbs to technical mountain trails. The <a href="/boulder/boulder-creek-path/">Boulder Creek Path</a> provides car-free riding through town, the canyon roads challenge roadies, and the surrounding foothills hide excellent singletrack. Whatever kind of riding you want to do, you can do it here.</p>

                    <h2 id="road">Road Cycling</h2>

                    <p><strong>Flagstaff Mountain</strong> is the classic Boulder climb. Starting from town, the 4.5-mile ascent gains 2,000 feet via switchbacks through pine forest. It's steep, sustained, and humbling at altitude. The views from the summit explain why locals do this ride weekly. Descend the same way or continue over to <a href="/boulder/nederland/">Nederland</a> for a longer adventure.</p>

                    <p><strong>Lefthand Canyon</strong> heads northwest from Boulder toward Ward, offering a longer, more gradual climb than Flagstaff. The road winds through canyon walls and mountain scenery, with several destination options depending on your ambition. It's a favorite training ride for pros and amateurs alike.</p>

                    <p><strong>Peak-to-Peak Highway</strong> connects mountain towns along the Continental Divide, offering spectacular high-altitude riding. Most riders access it via Boulder Canyon or Lefthand Canyon, then cruise the ridge with views in every direction. It's a long day but worth the effort for the scenery alone.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Morning Loop</strong> is a local favorite: Boulder Canyon to <a href="/boulder/nederland/">Nederland</a>, back via Highway 72 and Lefthand Canyon. It's about 50 miles with serious climbing, but the variety of terrain and scenery makes it fly by.</p>

                    <h2 id="mountain">Mountain Biking</h2>

                    <p><strong>Marshall Mesa</strong> is Boulder's most accessible mountain biking, with easy-to-moderate trails just south of town. The views of the <a href="/boulder/flatirons/">Flatirons</a> are excellent, and the terrain suits beginners and intermediates. More advanced riders can link to longer loops.</p>

                    <p><strong>Betasso Preserve</strong> offers buff singletrack on the canyon loop west of town. The trails are well-maintained, the climbing is manageable, and the forest setting feels remote despite proximity to Boulder. Direction of travel alternates daily to reduce trail conflict.</p>

                    <p><strong>Walker Ranch</strong> is Boulder's most challenging local loop - 7+ miles of rocky, technical terrain with significant climbing. The Eldorado Canyon views are stunning, but the trail demands respect. Best for experienced riders.</p>

                    <p><strong>Heil Valley Ranch</strong> north of town has miles of purpose-built mountain bike trails with varied difficulty. The flow trails are especially fun, drawing riders from across the Front Range.</p>

                    <h2 id="paths">Bike Paths</h2>

                    <p>Boulder's multi-use path system connects the entire city without requiring interaction with cars. The <a href="/boulder/boulder-creek-path/">Boulder Creek Path</a> forms the spine, running 16 miles from the mountains through downtown to the plains. Feeder paths branch to neighborhoods, parks, and trailheads.</p>

                    <p>The paths work for commuting, recreational riding, or connecting to other activities. You can bike from downtown to <a href="/boulder/chautauqua/">Chautauqua</a> for a hike, then ride back. The network is extensive enough that many Boulder residents own cars but rarely use them.</p>

                    <h2 id="rentals">Bike Rentals</h2>

                    <p><strong>University Bicycles</strong> near <a href="/boulder/pearl-street/">Pearl Street</a> rents road, mountain, and hybrid bikes. They also offer e-bikes for those who want assistance on the climbs. The staff knows the local routes and can recommend rides for your ability level.</p>

                    <p><strong>Full Cycle</strong> is another respected shop with rentals and deep local knowledge. Their mechanics are legit, and they can set you up for whatever riding you're planning.</p>

                    <p><strong>B-cycle</strong> stations throughout downtown offer short-term rentals for casual path riding. Good for getting around town, not designed for serious rides.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is Boulder good for beginner cyclists?</h4>
                            <p>Yes. The path system is flat and car-free, perfect for casual riding. Marshall Mesa offers gentle mountain biking. More challenging terrain is available when you're ready.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How does the altitude affect cycling?</h4>
                            <p>Noticeably. Boulder sits at 5,400 feet, and climbs go much higher. Visitors from sea level should expect reduced power output. Take it easier than you would at home, especially on the first few days.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I rent a high-end road bike?</h4>
                            <p>Yes. University Bicycles and Full Cycle both rent quality road bikes suitable for serious climbing. Reserve in advance during peak season.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Are the roads safe for cycling?</h4>
                            <p>Generally yes. Boulder has extensive bike lanes and a cycling-aware driving culture. Canyon roads require caution due to narrow shoulders and traffic, but drivers mostly respect cyclists.</p>
