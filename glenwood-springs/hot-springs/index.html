                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Size:</strong> World's largest hot springs pool (two blocks long). <strong>Temperature:</strong> Main pool 90-93°F, therapy pool 104°F. <strong>Hours:</strong> 9am-9pm daily (extended summer hours). <strong>Cost:</strong> ~$30 adults, less for kids.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Glenwood Hot Springs Pool has been drawing visitors since 1888. At over 400 feet long and 100 feet wide, it's the world's largest natural hot springs pool—big enough to do laps, though most people come to float and soak. The water is naturally heated by geothermal activity, rising from the earth at 122°F before being cooled to a comfortable swimming temperature.</p>

                    <p>The pool sits right in downtown Glenwood Springs, steps from the Hotel Colorado and the historic train depot. It's impossible to miss—you'll smell the sulfur before you see it. That mineral smell is part of the experience, and the water's therapeutic properties have attracted everyone from presidents to Doc Holliday over the past 135 years.</p>

                    <h2 id="pools">The Pools</h2>

                    <p><strong>Main Pool:</strong> The massive pool you've seen in photos. Kept at 90-93°F, it's warm enough to be comfortable but cool enough for swimming. At over 400 feet long, there's always room even on busy days. Depth ranges from 3 to 8 feet.</p>

                    <p><strong>Therapy Pool:</strong> The smaller, hotter option at 104°F. This is where you come to really soak. It's adults-only during certain hours, and the jets target sore muscles. If you're here for the therapeutic benefits, don't skip this one.</p>

                    <p><strong>Kiddie Pool:</strong> Shallow area for young children, kept at a comfortable temperature with zero-depth entry.</p>

                    <h2 id="facilities">Facilities</h2>

                    <p>The Glenwood Hot Springs Resort includes more than just the pools. The complex has a full-service spa, athletic club, lodge rooms, and a water slide that kids (and adults) love. Locker rooms have everything you need—showers, lockers, towel rental if you forgot yours.</p>

                    <p><strong>Spa of the Rockies:</strong> Full-service spa offering massages, facials, and body treatments. Combine a soak with a massage for the full relaxation experience.</p>

                    <p><strong>Athletic Club:</strong> Weight room, cardio equipment, and fitness classes. Many locals combine a workout with a post-exercise soak.</p>

                    <p><strong>Glenwood Hot Springs Lodge:</strong> The on-site hotel with direct pool access. Staying here means unlimited pool visits during your stay.</p>

                    <h2 id="visiting">When to Visit</h2>

                    <p><strong>Best time of year:</strong> Winter is magical—steam rising off the water, snow falling around you, mountains visible through the mist. The contrast between cold air and hot water makes winter soaking unforgettable.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best time of day:</strong> Early morning and evening are least crowded. Midday on weekends can get busy, especially in summer when families arrive.</p>

                    <p><strong>How long to stay:</strong> Most people spend 2-3 hours. You can stay all day if you want—your admission is good for the full day.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Practical Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Bring flip-flops.</strong> The deck can be hot in summer and slippery year-round. You'll want something for your feet.</p>

                    <p><strong>The sulfur smell fades.</strong> You'll notice it when you arrive, forget about it while you're soaking, and your swimsuit will smell like it for a while after. It's natural mineral water—embrace it.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stay hydrated.</strong> Hot springs dehydrate you faster than you realize. Drink water before, during, and after your soak. The resort has water fountains and sells beverages.</p>

                    <p><strong>Don't stay in too long.</strong> The heat is relaxing but can also exhaust you. Take breaks, especially in the therapy pool. If you feel lightheaded, get out and cool down.</p>

                    <p><strong>Combine with other activities.</strong> Many visitors do <a href="/glenwood-springs/hanging-lake/">Hanging Lake</a> in the morning and soak in the afternoon. It's the perfect recovery after a hike.</p>

                    <h2 id="vs-iron-mountain">Hot Springs Pool vs. Iron Mountain</h2>

                    <p>Glenwood Springs has two hot springs options. The main pool is the classic, bucket-list experience—massive, historic, and affordable. <a href="/glenwood-springs/iron-mountain/">Iron Mountain Hot Springs</a> is newer, smaller, and more upscale with individual pools and river views.</p>

                    <p><strong>Choose the main pool if:</strong> You want the iconic experience, are traveling with kids, prefer swimming laps, or want to save money.</p>

                    <p><strong>Choose Iron Mountain if:</strong> You want a quieter, more intimate experience, prefer adults-only soaking, or want multiple pools at different temperatures.</p>

                    <p>Many visitors do both during a multi-day stay. They're different experiences, and both are excellent.</p>
