                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> 987 Lookout Mountain Rd, Golden. <strong>Hours:</strong> 9am-5pm daily (seasonal variations). <strong>Admission:</strong> $5 adults, $4 seniors, $1 children 6-15, free under 6. <strong>Parking:</strong> Free lot on-site.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>William F. "Buffalo Bill" Cody was the most famous American of his era - scout, buffalo hunter, showman, and creator of the Wild West show that toured the world. When he died in 1917, his burial site on Lookout Mountain became an instant pilgrimage destination. The museum that grew up around his grave tells the story of both the man and the mythology of the American West.</p>

                    <p>The location is stunning. Lookout Mountain rises directly above Golden, offering panoramic views of Denver, the plains stretching to Kansas, and the snow-capped peaks of the Continental Divide. Buffalo Bill requested burial here, reportedly saying the view reminded him of the West he loved.</p>

                    <h2 id="museum">The Museum</h2>

                    <p>The museum houses an extensive collection of Buffalo Bill memorabilia including guns, costumes, posters, and personal effects. You'll see the rifle he used to hunt buffalo for the railroad, elaborate costumes from his Wild West show, and gifts from European royalty who attended his performances.</p>

                    <p>Exhibits cover his entire life - from his teenage years as a Pony Express rider, through his army service as a scout, his brief career as a buffalo hunter (he claimed to have killed 4,280 in 18 months), and his decades as an entertainer. The Wild West show section is particularly fascinating, showing how Cody essentially invented modern celebrity marketing.</p>

                    <p>The museum takes a nuanced approach to his legacy. Cody was complex - he employed Native Americans in his show and advocated for their rights while also participating in the subjugation of their lands. The exhibits don't shy away from these contradictions.</p>

                    <h2 id="grave">The Grave</h2>

                    <p>Buffalo Bill's grave sits at the highest point of Lookout Mountain, marked by a simple stone monument. The short walk from the museum to the grave passes through a peaceful pine forest. The grave site itself offers the best views - on clear days you can see from Pikes Peak in the south to the Wyoming border in the north.</p>

                    <p>A small controversy surrounds the burial location. The town of Cody, Wyoming (which Buffalo Bill founded) has long claimed he actually wanted to be buried there, and that his wife was paid by Denver interests to bury him on Lookout Mountain instead. In 1948, a group from Cody allegedly planned to steal the body. Today, the grave is encased in concrete to prevent any such attempts.</p>

                    <h2 id="visiting">Planning Your Visit</h2>

                    <p><strong>Getting there:</strong> From Golden, take Lookout Mountain Road (Lariat Loop) up the mountain. It's about 4 miles of winding road with spectacular views. From I-70, exit at Lookout Mountain and follow signs to the museum.</p>

                    <p><strong>Time needed:</strong> Allow 1-2 hours to see the museum and visit the grave. Add time if you want to hike the nearby <a href="/golden/lookout-mountain-nature-center/">nature center trails</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Morning light is best for views. Summer afternoons can be crowded with tour buses. The museum is less busy on weekdays.</p>

                    <p><strong>Combine with:</strong> The <a href="/golden/lookout-mountain-nature-center/">Lookout Mountain Nature Center</a> is just down the road. You can also drive the <a href="/golden/lariat-loop/">Lariat Loop</a> scenic byway that connects to the museum.</p>

                    <h2 id="gift-shop">Gift Shop & Cafe</h2>

                    <p>The gift shop is better than most museum shops, with quality Western art, books about Buffalo Bill and Western history, and Native American crafts. The Pahaska Tepee cafe serves basic food with excellent views from the outdoor patio.</p>
