                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> 20189 Cabrini Blvd, Golden. <strong>Hours:</strong> Grounds open daily 7am-5pm (extended summer hours). <strong>Admission:</strong> Free. <strong>The climb:</strong> 373 stone steps to the Sacred Heart of Jesus statue.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Mother Cabrini Shrine sits in the foothills west of Golden, a peaceful religious site with spectacular views and an unusual claim to fame - it's named for the first American citizen to be canonized as a saint. Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini established a summer camp for orphans on this land in 1912, and today the shrine commemorates her life and work.</p>

                    <p>The centerpiece is a 22-foot tall statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, standing atop a small mountain. To reach it, visitors climb 373 stone steps while praying the rosary at stations along the way. The climb is the main pilgrimage experience, though the grounds are beautiful even without making the ascent.</p>

                    <h2 id="stairway">The Stairway of Prayer</h2>

                    <p>The 373 steps represent the 373 stairs Mother Cabrini climbed daily to pray at the original Sacred Heart statue in Rome. The modern concrete steps wind up the hillside through pine forest, with the Stations of the Cross marked along the way.</p>

                    <p>The climb takes 15-25 minutes depending on your pace. It's not technically difficult but is a real workout - you'll gain about 350 feet of elevation. Benches at regular intervals allow rest stops. The stairs are wide and in good condition.</p>

                    <p>At the top, the view opens up dramatically. Denver spreads out to the east, the plains beyond, and the Continental Divide rises to the west. On clear days you can see Pikes Peak to the south. The statue itself is striking - Jesus with outstretched arms overlooking the valley.</p>

                    <h2 id="grounds">The Grounds</h2>

                    <p>Even without climbing to the statue, the shrine grounds are worth exploring. The <strong>Stone House</strong> was the original summer camp building where Mother Cabrini stayed. It's open for viewing and contains artifacts from her life.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>Grotto</strong> marks the spot where Mother Cabrini allegedly struck a rock and water sprang forth. A spring still flows here, and many visitors fill bottles with the water believing it has healing properties.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>Chapel</strong> offers a quiet space for reflection. Mass is celebrated regularly. A small gift shop sells religious items and books about Mother Cabrini's life.</p>

                    <p>Walking paths wind through the property connecting various shrines and prayer stations. The grounds are beautifully maintained with gardens, wildlife, and mountain views throughout.</p>

                    <h2 id="mother-cabrini">Who Was Mother Cabrini?</h2>

                    <p>Francesca Cabrini was born in Italy in 1850 and founded the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart. She came to America in 1889 to serve Italian immigrants and established schools, orphanages, and hospitals across the country. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1909.</p>

                    <p>After her death in 1917, miracles were attributed to her intercession. She was canonized by Pope Pius XII in 1946, becoming the first American citizen saint. The shrine in Golden was one of many institutions she founded during her remarkably active life.</p>

                    <h2 id="visiting">Planning Your Visit</h2>

                    <p><strong>Time needed:</strong> Allow 1-2 hours to explore the grounds and climb to the statue. Less if you only visit the lower areas.</p>

                    <p><strong>What to wear:</strong> Comfortable walking shoes for the stairs. Layers - it can be windy at the top. Sun protection.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Morning light is beautiful on the mountains. Avoid midday heat in summer. The shrine is busiest on weekends and religious holidays.</p>

                    <p><strong>Combine with:</strong> <a href="/golden/lookout-mountain-nature-center/">Lookout Mountain Nature Center</a> and <a href="/golden/buffalo-bill-museum/">Buffalo Bill's Grave</a> are nearby. All three can be visited in a morning or afternoon.</p>
