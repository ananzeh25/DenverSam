                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Main street:</strong> Washington Avenue. <strong>Famous landmark:</strong> "Where the West Lives" arch. <strong>Vibe:</strong> Small-town charm with mountain backdrop. <strong>Parking:</strong> Street parking and lots behind Washington Ave.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Downtown Golden is one of the most charming main streets in Colorado. Washington Avenue runs for about six blocks of locally-owned shops, restaurants, and bars, anchored at one end by the famous arch declaring "Where the West Lives" and framed by mountains on every side. It's walkable, photogenic, and genuinely pleasant in a way that feels authentic rather than manufactured.</p>

                    <p>The town has history - this was Colorado's territorial capital before Denver, and the brick buildings along Washington date to the late 1800s. But it's not a museum. The <a href="/golden/colorado-school-of-mines/">Colorado School of Mines</a> keeps the town young, and the proximity to outdoor recreation means the sidewalks are full of people in hiking boots and bike jerseys alongside tourists taking photos of the arch.</p>

                    <h2 id="arch">The Famous Arch</h2>

                    <p>The "Where the West Lives" arch spanning Washington Avenue is Golden's most photographed landmark. The first arch went up in 1949 as a welcome banner; the current incarnation has stood since 2008. It's the natural place to start your downtown exploration and an obligatory photo stop.</p>

                    <p>The phrase itself captures something real about Golden. This isn't a ski resort or a tourist creation - it's a working town that happens to have spectacular scenery and easy access to wilderness. The West does live here, in a way that feels more genuine than many Colorado towns.</p>

                    <h2 id="washington-avenue">Washington Avenue</h2>

                    <p>The main drag runs roughly north-south with most businesses concentrated between 10th and 15th Streets. It's entirely walkable - you can see everything in an hour of strolling, though you'll likely want longer if you're shopping or eating.</p>

                    <p><strong>Shops:</strong> A mix of outdoor gear stores, gift shops, galleries, and boutiques. Bent Gate Mountaineering is excellent for climbing and outdoor equipment. Several galleries feature Colorado artists. The shops skew toward quality over tourist kitsch.</p>

                    <p><strong>Food and Drink:</strong> The <a href="/golden/restaurants/">restaurant scene</a> clusters along Washington. <a href="/golden/craft-breweries/">Craft breweries</a>, pizza joints, upscale dining, and casual cafes offer something for every taste and budget. Most have patios for nice weather.</p>

                    <p><strong>Historic Buildings:</strong> Look up as you walk - many buildings have dates carved into their facades. The architecture is typical Colorado frontier town, with brick and stone buildings from the 1880s-1920s mixed with newer construction. The <a href="/golden/golden-history-museum/">Golden History Museum</a> can fill in the stories.</p>

                    <h2 id="clear-creek">Clear Creek & The Mill</h2>

                    <p><a href="/golden/clear-creek-trail/">Clear Creek</a> runs just behind Washington Avenue, and the trail along it is one of downtown's best features. You can watch kayakers play in the whitewater while walking between shops and restaurants.</p>

                    <p>The <a href="/golden/best-patios/">Golden Mill</a> sits right on the creek in a renovated historic mill building. It's a food hall with multiple vendors and a massive patio overlooking the water - the best outdoor drinking spot in town.</p>

                    <h2 id="walking-tour">Self-Guided Walking Tour</h2>

                    <p>Start at the arch on Washington Avenue and walk south. Here's what you'll pass:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>The Arch:</strong> Photo op, then head south</li>
                        <li><strong>Table Mountain Inn:</strong> Historic adobe building with Southwestern character</li>
                        <li><strong>Washington Avenue shops:</strong> Browse at your pace</li>
                        <li><strong>Detour to Clear Creek:</strong> Turn east to reach the trail and watch kayakers</li>
                        <li><strong>The Golden Mill:</strong> Stop for drinks on the patio</li>
                        <li><strong>Continue to 10th Street:</strong> <a href="/golden/american-mountaineering-center/">American Mountaineering Center</a> and <a href="/golden/golden-history-museum/">Golden History Museum</a> are nearby</li>
                        <li><strong>School of Mines campus:</strong> Walk through if time permits</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2 id="parking">Parking & Getting Around</h2>

                    <p><strong>Street parking:</strong> Available along Washington and side streets. Two-hour limits in most spots. Free but can be competitive on weekends.</p>

                    <p><strong>Parking lots:</strong> Municipal lots behind Washington Avenue offer additional parking. Some are free, some metered.</p>

                    <p><strong>From Denver:</strong> Golden is about 15 miles west of downtown Denver via 6th Avenue or I-70. About 20-30 minutes without traffic.</p>

                    <p><strong>RTD:</strong> Several bus routes connect Golden to Denver. The ride takes 30-45 minutes depending on route.</p>
