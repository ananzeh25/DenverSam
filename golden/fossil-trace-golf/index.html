                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> 3050 Illinois St, Golden. <strong>Par:</strong> 72. <strong>Yards:</strong> 6,831 (championship). <strong>Green fees:</strong> $75-150+ depending on season and time. <strong>Book:</strong> Online tee times recommended, especially weekends.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Fossil Trace is unlike any golf course you've played. Built on the site of a former clay mine, the course incorporates exposed rock formations containing actual dinosaur tracks, prehistoric plant fossils, and ancient insect impressions dating back 64 million years. You're literally playing golf through geological history.</p>

                    <p>The course opened in 2003 and has since been recognized as one of the most unique public courses in America. Golf Digest, Golfweek, and other publications have ranked it among the top public courses in Colorado. The fossils are the headline attraction, but the golf itself is excellent - challenging layout, beautiful mountain views, and immaculate conditioning.</p>

                    <h2 id="fossils">The Fossils</h2>

                    <p>During construction, paleontologists documented over 350 trace fossils in the exposed rock. Rather than removing them, the course designers incorporated them into the layout. Several holes play directly alongside or around the fossil beds.</p>

                    <p><strong>Dinosaur tracks</strong> are visible near several holes. These three-toed prints were made by theropod dinosaurs walking through mud that eventually became stone. Interpretive signs identify the fossils and explain what you're seeing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Plant fossils</strong> including palm fronds and other vegetation are embedded in the rock walls. These tell the story of Colorado's climate 64 million years ago when the area was a subtropical coastal plain.</p>

                    <p><strong>Insect traces</strong> and other small fossils are scattered throughout the exposed rock. The site is considered one of the most significant trace fossil locations in the Front Range.</p>

                    <h2 id="course">The Course</h2>

                    <p>Beyond the fossils, Fossil Trace is simply great golf. The layout uses the former mine's dramatic elevation changes and exposed rock walls to create memorable holes. Several tees and greens are carved into the rock formations.</p>

                    <p><strong>Hole 12</strong> is the signature hole - a dramatic par 3 playing over ancient rock formations to a green backed by towering walls of fossil-bearing stone. It's both beautiful and intimidating.</p>

                    <p>The course plays 6,831 yards from the tips but offers five sets of tees to accommodate all skill levels. Water comes into play on several holes. The rough can be punishing - the course maintains a links-style aesthetic with native grasses.</p>

                    <p>Mountain views are constant throughout the round. <a href="/golden/north-table-mountain/">North Table Mountain</a> rises immediately to the north, and the Continental Divide forms the western backdrop.</p>

                    <h2 id="facilities">Facilities</h2>

                    <p>The clubhouse has a pro shop, restaurant, and patio with mountain views. The practice facility includes a driving range, putting green, and short game area. Club rentals and lessons are available.</p>

                    <p>The on-site restaurant serves breakfast and lunch with solid pub food and Colorado craft beers. The patio is a popular post-round gathering spot with views of the 18th hole.</p>

                    <h2 id="booking">Booking and Rates</h2>

                    <p>Tee times can be booked online up to 14 days in advance for the public. Rates vary significantly by season and time of day - peak summer weekend mornings are most expensive, while winter twilight rates offer good value.</p>

                    <p>The course is popular, especially on weekends. Book early for preferred times. Walking is permitted but carts are included in most rates and recommended given the terrain.</p>

                            <p>Challenging but fair. Multiple tee options accommodate all skill levels. The rock walls and water hazards demand accuracy, but the course is playable for recreational golfers.</p>
