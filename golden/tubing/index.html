                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Season:</strong> Late June through August (when flows drop to safe levels). <strong>Water temp:</strong> Cold - 55-65°F even in summer. <strong>Duration:</strong> 20-45 minutes depending on section and flow. <strong>Cost:</strong> Tubes rent for $10-20/day from local outfitters.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Floating down Clear Creek on an inner tube is a quintessential Golden summer experience. The creek flows straight from the Rocky Mountains through town, offering a refreshing escape from summer heat. It's not whitewater rafting - tubing in Golden is mellow, scenic, and family-friendly when conditions are right.</p>

                    <p>Timing is everything. Early summer flows are too fast and dangerous for tubing. By late June or July, the snowmelt subsides and the creek becomes floatable. Local outfitters monitor conditions and will let you know when it's safe to tube.</p>

                    <h2 id="where-to-tube">Where to Tube</h2>

                    <p>The designated tubing section runs east of downtown Golden, downstream from the <a href="/golden/clear-creek-kayak-park/">whitewater kayak park</a>. This section is calmer with gentle riffles rather than rapids. Local outfitters will direct you to appropriate put-in and take-out points.</p>

                    <p><strong>Do not tube through downtown.</strong> The whitewater park section through downtown Golden is dangerous for tubers - it's designed for skilled kayakers with proper equipment. Several drownings have occurred when inexperienced people attempted to tube through this area.</p>

                    <p>The safe tubing section is clearly marked by outfitters and typically runs about a mile of mellow floating. The creek passes through pleasant scenery with mountain views and ends near convenient parking areas.</p>

                    <h2 id="rentals">Tube Rentals</h2>

                    <p>Several outfitters in Golden rent tubes and provide shuttle service:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Tubes typically cost $10-20 for the day</li>
                        <li>Many outfitters offer shuttle service back to your car</li>
                        <li>Life jackets are usually included and strongly recommended</li>
                        <li>Some offer cooler tubes and other accessories</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Bringing your own tube is possible, but working with outfitters is recommended - they know current conditions and will stop renting if the creek is too high. They also provide the easiest logistics.</p>

                    <h2 id="safety">Safety Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Wait for safe conditions.</strong> Don't tube when flows are high. The creek can look deceptively calm while moving dangerously fast. Check with outfitters or look up USGS flow data - generally 150-300 cfs is ideal for tubing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wear a life jacket.</strong> Even strong swimmers can get in trouble in cold, moving water. Most drownings occur when people don't wear flotation.</p>

                    <p><strong>The water is cold.</strong> Clear Creek runs 55-65°F even in August. That's cold enough to cause hypothermia with prolonged exposure. Limit your time in the water and get out if you feel chilled.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wear shoes.</strong> You'll need to walk to and from the creek, and the bottom has rocks. Water shoes, old sneakers, or sandals with straps all work.</p>

                    <p><strong>Secure your belongings.</strong> Don't bring anything you can't afford to lose. Waterproof pouches for phones are available but dropping things is common.</p>

                    <p><strong>No glass.</strong> Glass containers are prohibited along the creek. Bring cans or plastic bottles.</p>

                    <p><strong>Watch for hazards.</strong> Even in the mellow section, stay alert for rocks, branches, and other obstacles. Keep feet up and forward so you can push off obstacles.</p>

                    <h2 id="when">Best Times to Tube</h2>

                    <p><strong>Season:</strong> Late June through August, depending on snowpack. In heavy snow years, the creek may not be safe for tubing until mid-July.</p>

                    <p><strong>Time of day:</strong> Afternoon is warmest but can be crowded on weekends. Morning is quieter but cooler.</p>

                    <p><strong>Day of week:</strong> Weekends are busy. Weekdays offer a more relaxed experience.</p>

                    <p><strong>Weather:</strong> Pick a warm, sunny day. Even on hot days, you'll be cold after floating. Plan to warm up with lunch at one of <a href="/golden/restaurants/">Golden's restaurants</a> or a beer at a <a href="/golden/craft-breweries/">local brewery</a>.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is tubing safe for kids?</h4>
                            <p>When conditions are right and kids wear life jackets, yes. Children should be comfortable in water and strong swimmers. Check with outfitters about age recommendations.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Do I need to know how to swim?</h4>
                            <p>Basic swimming ability is recommended. You'll wear a life jacket, but you should be comfortable if you fall off your tube.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How cold is the water really?</h4>
                            <p>Cold enough to make you gasp when you get in. Expect 55-65°F. It's refreshing on a hot day but you'll want to dry off and warm up after.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">

                            <p>Yes, but no glass. Cans only. Please don't litter - pack out what you pack in. Drinking and water don't mix well, so be responsible.</p>
