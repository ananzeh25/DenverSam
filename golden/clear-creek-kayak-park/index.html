                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Downtown Golden along Clear Creek. <strong>Skill level:</strong> Intermediate to advanced. <strong>Best season:</strong> May-July for peak flows. <strong>Features:</strong> Multiple whitewater play features and surf waves.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Clear Creek Whitewater Park is one of Colorado's premier urban kayaking venues. Built into the natural creek bed running through downtown Golden, the course features engineered waves and drops that attract skilled paddlers from across the region. It's also one of the best spectator spots in town - watching kayakers surf, spin, and occasionally swim is free entertainment from the <a href="/golden/clear-creek-trail/">creekside trail</a>.</p>

                    <p>The park was developed in partnership with the city and kayaking community to create reliable play features that work across a range of water levels. Unlike natural whitewater that changes with every flood, these engineered features provide consistent conditions - though the character changes significantly with water flow.</p>

                    <h2 id="features">Whitewater Features</h2>

                    <p>The park includes several distinct features along a half-mile stretch of creek through downtown:</p>

                    <p><strong>The Library Wave:</strong> The most popular feature, located behind the Golden Library. A reliable surf wave that forms at moderate to high flows. Can get crowded on summer evenings when locals gather for after-work sessions.</p>

                    <p><strong>10th Street Drop:</strong> A small drop near the 10th Street bridge that creates a hole feature. Good for practicing basic playboating moves.</p>

                    <p><strong>Upper Features:</strong> Several additional waves and eddies in the upper section provide variety. These features are more flow-dependent.</p>

                    <p>The features change character significantly with water level. High spring flows create powerful waves suitable for advanced paddlers. Summer base flows offer gentler conditions.</p>

                    <h2 id="skill-level">Skill Requirements</h2>

                    <p>This is not a beginner venue. The cold, fast water and rocky bottom create real hazards. You should have:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Solid roll (you will flip)</li>
                        <li>Comfortable swimming in swift current</li>
                        <li>Experience reading whitewater</li>
                        <li>Proper equipment including helmet, PFD, and cold-water gear</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>During high water (typically late May through June), the features become significantly more powerful and are appropriate only for advanced paddlers. Several drownings have occurred over the years - respect the water.</p>

                    <p>If you're new to kayaking or want to try whitewater, take a lesson first. Several outfitters in the area offer instruction. The <a href="/golden/tubing/">tubing section</a> downstream offers a gentler introduction to the creek.</p>

                    <h2 id="conditions">Water Conditions</h2>

                    <p><strong>Spring runoff (May-June):</strong> Peak flows from snowmelt create the biggest waves and most challenging conditions. Water temperatures are cold - full wetsuits or drysuits required. This is when you'll see the most skilled paddlers pushing their limits.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summer (July-August):</strong> Flows drop to base levels. Features are smaller but more forgiving. Water warms slightly but remains cold. Good for practicing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fall/Winter:</strong> Low water and cold temperatures mean few paddlers. Some features don't work at all. Drysuit required.</p>

                    <p>Check current flow levels before heading out. The USGS gauge at Golden provides real-time data. Generally, 200-500 cfs offers good playboating conditions.</p>

                    <h2 id="access">Access and Etiquette</h2>

                    <p>The whitewater park is free and open to the public. Access points along the <a href="/golden/clear-creek-trail/">Clear Creek Trail</a> make it easy to scout features and enter the water.</p>

                    <p><strong>Parking:</strong> Street parking downtown or paid lots. Don't block residential driveways.</p>

                    <p><strong>Take turns:</strong> The main wave can get crowded. The informal rule is catch a wave, do your thing, peel off, and rotate to the back of the line.</p>

                    <p><strong>Be visible:</strong> Wear bright colors. Spectators and other paddlers need to see you.</p>

                    <p><strong>Respect the community:</strong> Golden welcomes kayakers but be a good guest. Don't change in public, pick up trash, and park legally.</p>

                    <h2 id="events">Events</h2>

                    <p>The <strong>Golden Games</strong> whitewater festival takes place annually in June when flows are high. The competition draws top paddlers from around the country and is great for spectators. Check the Golden Civic Foundation website for dates.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can beginners kayak here?</h4>
                            <p>No, this is an intermediate to advanced venue. Beginners should take lessons and build skills on flatwater before attempting whitewater.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I rent kayaks to use here?</h4>
                            <p>Some local shops rent whitewater kayaks, but they typically require proof of skill. You won't be able to rent a kayak and figure it out here - that's dangerous.</p>
