                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> 13th & Ford St, Golden. <strong>Cost:</strong> Free. <strong>Duration:</strong> 30-45 minutes. <strong>Age:</strong> All ages welcome, 21+ for samples. <strong>Reservations:</strong> Strongly recommended, especially weekends.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Coors Brewery in Golden is the world's largest single-site brewery, producing over 22 million barrels of beer annually. The free tour is one of the best deals in Colorado tourism - you get to see a massive industrial brewing operation, learn the history of one of America's oldest breweries, and finish with complimentary beer samples.</p>

                    <p>Adolph Coors chose Golden in 1873 for the pure Rocky Mountain spring water flowing from Clear Creek. That same water source still feeds the brewery today. The original stone malting facility still stands alongside modern production buildings that stretch for blocks.</p>

                    <h2 id="tour">What to Expect on the Tour</h2>

                    <p>Tours are self-guided through a designated path in the brewery. You'll see the malting process, the massive copper brewing kettles, the packaging lines that fill thousands of cans per minute, and the quality control labs. Informational displays and videos explain each step.</p>

                    <p>The scale is genuinely impressive. This isn't a craft brewery where you peek into a few tanks - you're walking through a facility that produces more beer than most countries consume. The packaging hall alone is the size of several football fields.</p>

                    <p>Tours end at the tasting room where adults 21+ receive three complimentary 8oz samples. They rotate seasonal and specialty beers alongside the core lineup. The rooftop patio has views of the foothills and is a great spot to enjoy your samples.</p>

                    <h2 id="booking">How to Book</h2>

                    <p>Reservations are made online through the Coors website. Tours run Thursday through Monday, typically from 10am to 4pm. Weekend slots fill up fast - book at least a week ahead for Saturday visits.</p>

                    <p>Walk-ups are accepted if space is available, but don't count on it during busy periods. Summer weekends and holiday periods are especially crowded. Weekday mornings tend to be the quietest times.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Tips for Your Visit</h2>

                    <p><strong>Wear comfortable shoes.</strong> The tour involves a fair amount of walking and stairs. The brewery floor can be slippery in spots.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bring ID.</strong> Even if you're obviously over 21, you'll need valid photo identification to receive beer samples. No exceptions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Plan for parking.</strong> The brewery has a free parking lot, but it fills up on busy days. Arrive 15-20 minutes before your tour time. Overflow parking is available on nearby streets.</p>

                    <p><strong>Combine with downtown Golden.</strong> The brewery is a 10-minute walk from Washington Avenue. Plan to grab lunch at one of the <a href="/golden/restaurants/">downtown restaurants</a> before or after your tour.</p>

                    <p><strong>Take the shuttle.</strong> A free shuttle runs between the parking area and the tour entrance. It's especially helpful on hot summer days or if you have mobility concerns.</p>

                    <h2 id="history">Brief History</h2>

                    <p>Adolph Coors immigrated from Germany in 1868 and worked at several breweries before founding his own in Golden in 1873. He chose the location for its access to pure mountain water and barley from the plains.</p>

                    <p>The brewery survived Prohibition by producing malted milk and near-beer. When Prohibition ended in 1933, Coors was one of the few breweries positioned to immediately resume production. The company remained family-owned until the 2005 merger with Molson.</p>

                    <p>Today, Molson Coors operates the Golden facility as their largest production brewery. Despite corporate ownership, the brewery maintains its connection to Golden and Colorado heritage.</p>
