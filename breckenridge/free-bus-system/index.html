                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Free within Breckenridge. <strong>Coverage:</strong> All ski base areas, Main Street, neighborhoods, Frisco connection. <strong>Hours:</strong> Early morning to late night (varies by route). <strong>Bottom line:</strong> No need for a car once you arrive.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Breckenridge's free bus system is one of the best reasons to leave your car parked. The buses connect all ski base areas, Main Street, lodging neighborhoods, and even nearby Frisco—all at no cost to riders. During ski season, they run frequently from early morning through late night, eliminating the need to deal with parking, icy roads, or designated drivers.</p>

                    <p>The system is operated by Breckenridge Free Ride and Summit Stage, working together to cover both in-town and regional routes. For visitors, it means freedom: ski a different peak in the afternoon than you did in the morning, hit the breweries after skiing without worrying about driving, and skip the $20-30 daily parking fees at the ski area.</p>

                    <h2 id="routes">Key Routes</h2>

                    <p><strong>Free Ride routes</strong> cover Breckenridge proper. Multiple routes serve different neighborhoods, all connecting to Main Street and the ski base areas. Look for the route map at any bus stop or download the Breckenridge app.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Main Street route</strong> runs north-south along the main corridor, stopping at key locations including the Transit Center, Main Street shops, and south toward the ski area. During peak times, buses run every 10-15 minutes.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ski area routes</strong> connect the different peak bases. If your lodging is near Peak 9 but you want to ski Peak 7, take the bus rather than moving your car. The flexibility is valuable.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summit Stage</strong> provides free regional service connecting Breckenridge to Frisco, Dillon, Silverthorne, and Keystone. Useful for accessing different restaurants, shops, or ski areas.</p>

                    <h2 id="schedule">Schedule & Frequency</h2>

                    <p><strong>Ski season service</strong> runs from approximately 6:30 AM to 11:30 PM, with the highest frequency during morning ski runs (7-9 AM) and après-ski hours (3-6 PM). Late-night service covers the bar-closing crowd.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summer service</strong> continues but with reduced frequency. The system still works well but you may wait longer between buses.</p>

                    <p><strong>Real-time tracking</strong> is available through the Breckenridge app and at many bus stops. Knowing when the next bus arrives makes the system much more usable.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Using the System</h2>

                    <p><strong>Plan for crowds.</strong> Morning buses heading to ski areas and après-ski buses back to town can be standing-room only. If you're skiing with children or lots of gear, the crowding can be challenging.</p>

                    <p><strong>Know your route.</strong> Multiple routes serve different neighborhoods. Make sure you're on the right bus—they're well-marked but it's easy to hop on the wrong one when you're new to town.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ski boots are fine.</strong> The buses accommodate ski boots, poles, and gear. Racks outside carry skis and boards. The system is designed for skiers.</p>

                    <p><strong>Night service for bars.</strong> The late-night routes exist specifically so you don't have to drive after drinking. Use them. DUI enforcement is serious in Summit County.</p>

                    <h2 id="parking">If You Do Drive</h2>

                    <p><strong>Park once.</strong> If you drive to Breckenridge, park at your lodging and use the bus from there. Moving your car daily defeats the purpose.</p>

                    <p><strong>Paid parking</strong> at the ski area costs $20-30/day during peak periods. The free buses are a better deal.</p>

                    <p><strong>Public lots</strong> exist on the north end of town near Airport Road. Park there and bus into the action.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is the bus really free?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, within Breckenridge and on Summit Stage regional routes. No tickets, no passes, just hop on. It's funded by local taxes.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I take skis on the bus?</h4>
                            <p>Yes. Exterior racks hold skis and snowboards. Bring them right up to the bus—drivers are used to it.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">

                            <p>Until approximately 11:30 PM during ski season, later on some routes. Late enough to get home from bars safely.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">

                            <p>Yes. Summit Stage connects Breckenridge to Keystone, Frisco, Dillon, and Silverthorne. Takes longer than driving but it's free.</p>
