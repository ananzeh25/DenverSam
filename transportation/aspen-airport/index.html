<p><strong>Quick facts:</strong> Aspen-Pitkin County Airport (ASE) is 4 miles from downtown Aspen—about 10 minutes by car. Direct flights from Denver, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, LA, and other cities (seasonal). Weather delays and cancellations are common due to the challenging approach. Alternative: Eagle County Airport (EGE) is 90 minutes away with more reliable operations.</p>
</div>

<h2>About Aspen Airport</h2>

<p>Aspen-Pitkin County Airport sits at 7,838 feet elevation in a narrow valley surrounded by mountains. The challenging terrain means flights can only operate in good weather conditions. Delays and cancellations are more common here than at most airports, especially during winter storms.</p>

<p>Despite the operational challenges, flying into ASE is extremely convenient when flights operate on schedule. The airport is small and easy to navigate, and downtown Aspen is just minutes away.</p>

<h2>Airlines and Destinations</h2>

<p>United, American, and Delta serve ASE with seasonal schedules. Direct flights are available from Denver (year-round), Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and other major cities (mostly winter season only). Summer service is more limited.</p>

<p>Flight prices are typically higher than flying into Denver or Eagle County, especially during ski season.</p>

<h2>Ground Transportation</h2>

<p>From ASE to downtown Aspen, the options include taxi ($30-40), rideshare (similar pricing when available), hotel shuttles (many Aspen hotels offer complimentary pickup), and rental cars (available at the airport). The drive takes about 10 minutes.</p>

<p>RFTA buses run between the airport and downtown Aspen for about $5—the most affordable option if you're not in a rush.</p>

<h2>Weather Considerations</h2>

<p>ASE has one of the highest cancellation rates among US airports due to weather. The visual approach required in poor visibility means flights are often cancelled or delayed when clouds, snow, or wind affect the valley.</p>

<p>During winter trips, have a backup plan. Eagle County Airport is 90 minutes away and operates more reliably. Some travelers book refundable tickets into ASE with backup reservations into Eagle.</p>

<h2>Alternative: Eagle County Airport</h2>

<p>Eagle County Regional Airport (EGE) is 90 minutes from Aspen but has a longer runway and more reliable operations. More airlines serve Eagle, often with lower fares. Shuttle services and rental cars connect Eagle to Aspen.</p>

<p>For travelers prioritizing schedule reliability over convenience, Eagle is often the better choice, especially for ski trips where losing a day to flight issues matters.</p>
