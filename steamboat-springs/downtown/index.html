                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Main street:</strong> Lincoln Avenue. <strong>Character:</strong> Western storefronts, real ranching community. <strong>Vibe:</strong> Authentic Colorado—less polished than Vail, more genuine. <strong>Key landmark:</strong> Howelsen Hill ski area right downtown.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Downtown Steamboat Springs is what Colorado ski towns used to be—and mostly aren't anymore. Real ranchers still walk Lincoln Avenue. Western storefronts house local businesses rather than luxury brands. The ski resort is a few miles away, keeping downtown grounded in its ranching roots.</p>

                    <p>This is Ski Town USA, the birthplace of more Winter Olympians than anywhere else in North America. But it's also a working agricultural community that happens to have world-class skiing. That combination creates a character you won't find in purpose-built resorts.</p>

                    <h2 id="lincoln">Lincoln Avenue</h2>

                    <p>The main drag. Western facades line both sides of this wide street, housing shops, restaurants, and bars. The architecture is genuine—many buildings date to the late 1800s and early 1900s. No fake Old West here.</p>

                    <p><strong>The vibe:</strong> Relaxed and unpretentious. You'll see ski bums in the same bars as ranchers. The dress code is whatever you're wearing. This isn't Aspen.</p>

                    <p><strong>Shopping:</strong> Local outdoor shops, Western wear, art galleries, and gift stores. F.M. Light & Sons has been selling Western clothing since 1905. Off the Beaten Path is one of the best independent bookstores in Colorado.</p>

                    <p><strong>Nightlife:</strong> The bars here are legendary. The Tugboat Grill & Pub has been an après-ski institution for decades. Schmiggity's is the late-night dance spot. Sunpies serves craft cocktails in a speakeasy setting.</p>

                    <h2 id="howelsen">Howelsen Hill</h2>

                    <p>Right in the middle of downtown, Howelsen Hill is the oldest operating ski area in Colorado. It's where Olympians train on the ski jumps visible from Lincoln Avenue. And it's where locals ski after work under the lights.</p>

                    <p><strong>Night skiing:</strong> Howelsen offers affordable night skiing—a few runs lit until 8pm. It's a local tradition and a fun way to get extra turns without fighting resort crowds.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ski jumping:</strong> Watch Olympic-caliber athletes train on the jumps. Steamboat's Winter Sports Club uses this facility, and practices are often open for viewing.</p>

                    <h2 id="yampa">Yampa River Core Trail</h2>

                    <p>The Yampa River flows right through downtown, and a paved trail follows its banks. Perfect for a morning run, an evening stroll, or watching tubers float by in summer. The trail connects downtown to the ski resort base area.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Walk everywhere downtown.</strong> Lincoln Avenue is about half a mile of shops and restaurants. Park once and explore on foot.</p>

                    <p><strong>Check the rodeo schedule.</strong> Summer Friday and Saturday nights bring the <a href="/steamboat-springs/rodeo/">pro rodeo series</a> to Howelsen Hill. It's been running since 1914.</p>

                    <p><strong>Don't skip the local bars.</strong> The Tugboat and Schmiggity's are institutions. They're not fancy, but they're genuine—and that's the point.</p>

                    <p><strong>Time your visit for First Friday.</strong> Art walks and gallery openings happen the first Friday of each month during summer and winter seasons.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is downtown separate from the ski resort?</h4>
                            <p>Yes. The ski resort base is about 3 miles from downtown. Free buses connect the two. This separation helps downtown maintain its authentic character.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Where should I stay—downtown or ski base?</h4>
                            <p>Downtown for nightlife and local atmosphere. Ski base for slope-side convenience. Both have merits. The free bus makes either work.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is downtown walkable?</h4>
                            <p>Very. Lincoln Avenue is flat and about half a mile of concentrated shops and restaurants. Everything is close together.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What's the dress code?</h4>
                            <p>Casual. Ski clothes, jeans, whatever. This isn't a pretentious town. Even the nicer restaurants don't require dressing up.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is Steamboat less crowded than Vail?</h4>
                            <p>Yes. The distance from Denver (3 hours vs 2) filters out day-trippers. Downtown feels manageable even during busy weeks.</p>
