                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Season:</strong> Late May–early October. <strong>Weather:</strong> 70s-80s days, 40s-50s nights. <strong>Highlights:</strong> Hiking, festivals, free gondola rides, wildflowers. Afternoon thunderstorms almost daily—plan outdoor activities for morning.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Summer in Telluride might be better than winter. The snow melts to reveal wildflower meadows, alpine lakes, and endless outdoor possibilities. The <a href="/telluride/festivals/">festival calendar</a> fills every weekend with music, film, and culture. And the <a href="/telluride/gondola/">free gondola</a> still runs, connecting town to Mountain Village's hiking and biking trails.</p>

                    <p>The pace is different too. Winter's urgency—first chair, last run, après deadlines—gives way to leisurely mornings, long hikes, and sunset drinks on a deck. If you only know Telluride as a ski town, you're missing half the story.</p>

                    <h2 id="hiking">Hiking</h2>

                    <p>The box canyon setting means world-class <a href="/telluride/hiking/">hiking</a> starts right from town. Bear Creek Falls and Jud Wiebe Trail are accessible within walking distance of Main Street. No car required, no shuttles needed—just lace up your boots and go.</p>

                    <p>For bigger objectives, Blue Lake and Hope Lake offer alpine lake rewards for those willing to climb. The terrain ranges from family-friendly waterfall walks to technical 14er scrambles. Whatever your fitness level, there's a trail that matches.</p>

                    <p><strong>Prime season:</strong> Late June through September. July brings wildflowers; September brings fall colors. Both are spectacular.</p>

                    <h2 id="biking">Mountain Biking</h2>

                    <p>Telluride's ski mountain transforms into a bike park in summer. Lift-served downhill from Mountain Village gets you to the goods without the climb. Cross-country trails wind through alpine meadows with views that distract dangerously from the trail ahead.</p>

                    <p>The <a href="/telluride/gondola/">free gondola</a> carries bikes, making it practical to ride down to town and gondola back up. Road cyclists can create loops combining the gondola with Last Dollar Road or the highway to Placerville.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rentals:</strong> Available in town and Mountain Village. Bootdoctors and other shops offer everything from hardtails to full-suspension downhill rigs.</p>

                    <h2 id="water">Water Activities</h2>

                    <p><strong>Fly fishing:</strong> The San Miguel River runs right through town, holding brown and rainbow trout. Guided trips access private water for better fishing. Mountain lakes offer backcountry options for those willing to hike.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rafting:</strong> The San Miguel and Dolores Rivers offer Class II-IV whitewater within day-trip range. Best flows come in June and early July during snowmelt. Several outfitters run trips from Telluride.</p>

                    <p><strong>Paddleboarding:</strong> Alta Lakes and Trout Lake provide calm water for SUP. Mornings are glassiest before afternoon winds pick up. Rentals available in town.</p>

                    <h2 id="unique">Unique Experiences</h2>

                    <p><strong>Via Ferrata:</strong> A protected climbing route on the mountain using iron rungs, cables, and bridges. Exposure and views without technical climbing skills. Guided tours required—Telluride Adventures runs them regularly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Golf:</strong> Telluride Golf Club offers 18 holes at 9,500 feet. Mountain views on every hole, and the altitude adds distance to every shot. Tee times book up in peak season.</p>

                    <p><strong>Horseback riding:</strong> Several outfitters offer trail rides into the backcountry. Multi-day pack trips available for deeper wilderness access.</p>

                    <p><strong>Paragliding:</strong> Tandem flights launch from above town, offering a bird's-eye view of the box canyon. Weather-dependent, but unforgettable when conditions align.</p>

                    <h2 id="jeep">Jeep Tours</h2>

                    <p>Summer opens the legendary <a href="/telluride/jeep-trails/">4x4 routes</a> that make the San Juans famous. Imogene Pass, Black Bear Road, and Ophir Pass offer everything from scenic cruises to white-knuckle descents. Rent a Jeep or book a guided tour—the views at 13,000 feet are worth the effort either way.</p>

                    <h2 id="town">In-Town Activities</h2>

                    <p><strong>Free gondola:</strong> It's worth riding just for the views, even if you're not going anywhere. Sunset rides are particularly spectacular. Pack wine and snacks.</p>

                    <p><strong>Festivals:</strong> Bluegrass in June, Film Festival on Labor Day, Blues & Brews in September—and many more in between. Check the calendar before booking; festivals transform the town.</p>

                    <p><strong>Main Street:</strong> Galleries, boutiques, and restaurants that feel different with the pressure of ski season lifted. Summer dining moves outdoors onto patios and decks.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Summer Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Start early.</strong> Afternoon thunderstorms build almost daily, typically 1-3pm. Plan outdoor activities for morning, and have indoor backup plans for afternoon.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pack layers.</strong> Temperatures can swing 30+ degrees between morning and afternoon, and another 30 degrees between town and alpine elevation. Rain gear is essential.</p>

                    <p><strong>Book festival weekends early.</strong> Bluegrass and Film Festival fill the town completely. Lodging prices triple and availability disappears months ahead.</p>

                    <p><strong>The altitude matters.</strong> Town sits at 8,750 feet; hikes go higher. Hydrate constantly, take it easy the first day, and listen to your body. Altitude sickness is real.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summer is cheaper than winter.</strong> Outside festival weekends, lodging rates drop significantly. Restaurants are less crowded, reservations are easier, and the town has a more relaxed vibe.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What's the weather like in summer?</h4>
                            <p>Highs in the 70s-80s, lows in the 40s-50s. Mornings are typically clear; afternoon thunderstorms are common. Pack layers and rain gear.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>When is wildflower season?</h4>
                            <p>Mid-July through early August for peak blooms. Higher elevation meadows bloom later. Trails to alpine lakes offer the most dramatic displays.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Do I need a car in summer?</h4>
                            <p>Less than in winter. Hiking trails start from town, the gondola accesses Mountain Village, and the free bus serves local areas. A car helps for Jeep trails and distant trailheads.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">

                            <p>Yes, always free. It runs 7am-midnight in summer, connecting town to Mountain Village. Bikes and dogs welcome.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Best summer month to visit?</h4>
                            <p>July for wildflowers, September for fall colors and fewer crowds. August is peak festival season. Each has its appeal.</p>
