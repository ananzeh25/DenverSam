                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Price range:</strong> Comparable to Aspen. <strong>Reservations:</strong> Essential during ski season and festivals. <strong>Best views:</strong> Allred's (gondola access). <strong>Best value:</strong> Brown Dog Pizza. Most restaurants on Main Street.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>For a town of 2,500 people, Telluride punches well above its weight in dining. The resort crowd demands quality, and the restaurant scene delivers—from elevated American cuisine at 10,000 feet to pizza joints that locals actually frequent. Expect prices comparable to Aspen, but also flavors that match the altitude.</p>

                    <p>Reservations are essential during ski season and festival weekends. During Film Festival, you might not get a table anywhere without planning weeks ahead. Shoulder seasons are more forgiving.</p>

                    <h2 id="fine">Fine Dining</h2>

                    <p>These are the special occasion spots. Plan ahead, dress up (mountain casual—nobody expects a jacket), and bring your appetite.</p>

                    <p><strong>Allred's:</strong> The gondola restaurant at 10,551 feet. Ride the <a href="/telluride/gondola/">free gondola</a> to Mountain Village and walk to a dining room with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the San Juans. The food is contemporary American with excellent wine pairings. Even if you don't dine, ride up for sunset cocktails—the view alone is worth it. Reserve well ahead.</p>

                    <p><strong>Alpino Vino:</strong> European-style hut dining on the ski mountain. Getting there requires a snowcat ride up. The experience is intimate—communal seating, wine-paired courses, and a sense that you've escaped to the Alps. Winter only, and reservations book weeks out. This is the most romantic dinner in Telluride.</p>

                    <p><strong>221 South Oak:</strong> Creative American cuisine in a Victorian house just off Main Street. Chef-driven menu changes seasonally, focusing on local ingredients when possible. More intimate than Allred's, with equally impressive food. The kind of place where the server knows what you should order.</p>

                    <p><strong>Chop House:</strong> Prime steaks and fresh seafood in the New Sheridan Hotel. Classic American fine dining in a historic setting—this is where the town has celebrated since 1895. The bar is worth visiting even if you don't stay for dinner.</p>

                    <h2 id="casual">Casual Dining</h2>

                    <p>These spots deliver quality without pretense. Most are on or near Main Street, and reservations help but aren't always required.</p>

                    <p><strong>Brown Dog Pizza:</strong> The locals' pizza joint. Detroit-style pies that would hold up in any city, plus a solid craft beer selection. No reservations—just show up and wait if you have to. Family-friendly, casual, and consistently good.</p>

                    <p><strong>La Marmotte:</strong> French bistro in a cozy Victorian space. Onion soup, steak frites, duck confit—classic preparations done well. The wine list is better than you'd expect for a mountain town. More approachable prices than the fine dining spots.</p>

                    <p><strong>Oak Telluride:</strong> Modern American with a wood-fired focus. Strong cocktail program and a lively bar scene that makes it good for solo travelers. The balance of quality and value lands right where you want it for everyday dining.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rustico Ristorante:</strong> Italian comfort food with house-made pasta. Not fancy, but the kind of place you want after a long ski day when you're hungry and tired. Good for families and groups who don't need fine dining every night.</p>

                    <p><strong>Honga's Lotus Petal:</strong> Pan-Asian in a colorful Main Street space. Sushi, noodles, Thai dishes, and good vegetarian options. The quirky local favorite that surprises people who weren't expecting quality Asian food in a Colorado ski town.</p>

                    <h2 id="quick">Quick Bites and Coffee</h2>

                    <p>Fuel up before hitting the trails or slopes without spending an hour at a table.</p>

                    <p><strong>Baked in Telluride:</strong> The breakfast institution. Massive cinnamon rolls, breakfast burritos, and coffee strong enough to wake you up for first chair. Get there early on ski mornings—the line forms fast.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Butcher & The Baker:</strong> Artisan sandwiches and baked goods. House-cured meats, fresh bread, and picnic provisions perfect for a hike. The grab-and-go option when you want quality without sitting down.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ghost Town Coffee:</strong> Local roaster with a tiny Main Street cafe. Some of the best espresso in town, and the beans are roasted nearby. Limited seating, but worth the wait.</p>

                    <h2 id="apres">Après-Ski</h2>

                    <p><strong>There:</strong> Mountain Village's best après spot. Good food, strong drinks, and a deck with views. The vibe is lively without being obnoxious—the kind of place where one drink becomes three.</p>

                    <p><strong>Last Dollar Saloon:</strong> The local bar on Main Street. Cheap drinks, ski bum atmosphere, and zero pretension. Not for craft cocktails, but perfect for beer and shots after a long day.</p>

                    <p><strong>Smuggler's Brewpub:</strong> House-brewed beers and elevated pub fare. Good for groups, outdoor seating when weather allows, and a solid middle ground between dive bar and restaurant.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Dining Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Reserve ahead for fine dining.</strong> Allred's and 221 South Oak book up days or weeks in advance during peak season. Don't arrive expecting to walk in.</p>

                    <p><strong>Casual spots fill up too.</strong> Brown Dog Pizza doesn't take reservations, but the wait can be 45 minutes on a Saturday night. Plan accordingly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Town vs. Mountain Village:</strong> Most restaurants are in historic Telluride. Mountain Village has Allred's and a few others, but the selection is limited. The <a href="/telluride/gondola/">gondola</a> runs until midnight, so you can dine in one area and sleep in the other.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bring cash for tips.</strong> Card readers work, but some servers prefer cash. The ATM fees at ski resorts are criminal.</p>
