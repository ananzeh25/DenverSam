                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Major festivals:</strong> Film (Labor Day), Bluegrass (June), Blues & Brews (September). <strong>Booking:</strong> 6-12 months ahead for Film and Bluegrass. Town transforms every summer weekend with music, film, and culture.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Telluride transforms into a different town each summer weekend. The box canyon becomes an amphitheater for world-class film premieres, legendary bluegrass performances, and a rotating calendar of cultural events. These festivals are why many visitors first discover Telluride—and why they keep coming back.</p>

                    <p>The challenge is planning. Major festivals sell out months in advance, and lodging becomes scarce and expensive. If you want to attend Film Festival or Bluegrass, you need to start planning the moment tickets go on sale.</p>

                    <h2 id="film">Telluride Film Festival</h2>

                    <p><strong>When:</strong> Labor Day weekend (late August/early September)</p>

                    <p>One of the world's most prestigious film festivals. Oscar contenders premiere here before anywhere else—many Academy Award winners had their first screenings in Telluride. Unlike Sundance or Cannes, the lineup isn't announced until the festival starts. You buy passes on faith, trusting the curators.</p>

                    <p>The atmosphere is intimate. Filmmakers and celebrities walk the same streets as festivalgoers. You might sit next to a famous director at a screening or bump into an actor grabbing coffee. The town's small size means everyone mixes.</p>

                    <p><strong>Passes:</strong> Range from day passes to full festival access. Prices start around $300 and climb to $6,000+ for all-access credentials. Everything sells out months ahead. The patron passes include parties and priority seating.</p>

                    <p><strong>Without a pass:</strong> Some outdoor screenings in Elks Park are free. The town atmosphere is worth experiencing even if you can't get theater access. But the real festival requires a pass.</p>

                    <h2 id="bluegrass">Telluride Bluegrass Festival</h2>

                    <p><strong>When:</strong> Late June (Thursday–Sunday, 4 days)</p>

                    <p>The granddaddy of Colorado music festivals, running since 1974. Sam Bush, Bela Fleck, and bluegrass legends have graced the Town Park stage for decades. The festival has expanded to include folk, Americana, and acoustic music beyond traditional bluegrass, but the roots remain.</p>

                    <p>Many attendees camp in Town Park, creating a community that starts days before the first note. The camping experience is as much a part of Bluegrass as the music itself. If you're not camping, expect lodging prices to triple.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tickets:</strong> Four-day passes sell out within hours of going on sale. Set a calendar reminder for the on-sale date (usually late winter). Camping passes are even harder to get—there's a lottery system.</p>

                    <h2 id="blues">Blues & Brews</h2>

                    <p><strong>When:</strong> Mid-September (3 days)</p>

                    <p>Blues, funk, and soul with Colorado craft beer. Town Park venue with the same mountain backdrop as Bluegrass, but a different energy—more party, less jam session. The September timing means fall colors are starting and summer crowds have thinned.</p>

                    <p>More accessible than Bluegrass. Tickets are easier to get, and the atmosphere is welcoming for first-timers. A good introduction to Telluride festivals if you're not ready for the full Bluegrass commitment.</p>

                    <h2 id="more">More Festivals</h2>

                    <p><strong>Jazz Festival (early August):</strong> Jazz, funk, and soul in an intimate mountain setting. Smaller than Bluegrass, but equally talented lineups. Town Park and Mountain Village venues.</p>

                    <p><strong>Yoga Festival (July):</strong> Four days of yoga, meditation, and wellness workshops. Classes for all levels with renowned instructors. The mountain setting adds something to downward dog.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wine Festival (late June):</strong> Grand tastings, winemaker dinners, and seminars. One of the top wine events in Colorado. Often scheduled the week before Bluegrass.</p>

                    <p><strong>Mushroom Festival (late August):</strong> Mycology meets mountain town. Forays, workshops, and cooking demos. One of the largest fungi festivals in North America. More popular than you'd expect.</p>

                    <p><strong>Horror Show (October):</strong> Genre film festival for horror, sci-fi, and fantasy fans. Independent and international films. Perfect timing for Halloween and fall colors.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Festival Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Book early—really early.</strong> For Film Festival and Bluegrass, book lodging 6-12 months ahead. Passes sell out even earlier. If you're hoping for last-minute tickets, you're hoping for luck.</p>

                    <p><strong>Consider staying outside town.</strong> Montrose, Ridgway, and Ouray are 40-65 miles away but offer more affordable lodging. You'll need a car, and you'll miss the late-night atmosphere, but you'll save hundreds per night.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pack for mountain weather.</strong> Even in summer, temperatures drop into the 40s at night. Layers, rain gear, and warm sleeping gear (if camping) are essential. Festival camping means cold nights.</p>

                    <p><strong>The gondola runs late.</strong> During festivals, the <a href="/telluride/gondola/">free gondola</a> operates until midnight. You can stay in Mountain Village and still catch late shows in town.</p>

                    <p><strong>Arrive early, stay late.</strong> Festival energy builds before the official start and lingers after. The days surrounding the festival are often the best—smaller crowds, same atmosphere.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Which festival is easiest to attend?</h4>
                            <p>Blues & Brews. Tickets are more available, lodging is easier to find (September is shoulder season), and the atmosphere is welcoming for first-timers.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
