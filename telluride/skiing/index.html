                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Skiable acres:</strong> 2,000+. <strong>Vertical drop:</strong> 4,425 ft. <strong>Trails:</strong> 148 (23% beginner, 36% intermediate, 41% advanced). <strong>Annual snowfall:</strong> 280". <strong>Season:</strong> Late November–early April.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Telluride delivers what serious skiers crave: challenging terrain, stunning scenery, and fewer crowds than the I-70 corridor resorts. The trade-off is getting here—it's a 6-hour drive from Denver or a flight to Montrose. But that remoteness is exactly what keeps the lift lines short and the powder untracked longer.</p>

                    <p>The resort spans two base areas connected by the <a href="/telluride/gondola/">free gondola</a>. Historic Telluride sits at the bottom of the front side; Mountain Village anchors the back. You can ski both sides in a single day, and the gondola makes it easy to stay in one area while accessing the other.</p>

                    <h2 id="terrain">The Terrain</h2>

                    <p>Telluride's terrain breakdown skews expert, but there's good skiing for everyone. The mountain naturally separates ability levels—beginners and intermediates stick to certain zones while advanced skiers disappear into the steeps.</p>

                    <p><strong>Revelation Bowl:</strong> The crown jewel. 733 acres of hike-to expert terrain that opened in 2008. Steep chutes, cliff bands, and wide-open powder fields. You'll need avalanche awareness and a willingness to hike for the goods. When it dumps, this is where you want to be.</p>

                    <p><strong>Gold Hill:</strong> Above-treeline expert terrain accessible via Lift 14. At 12,260 feet, the air is thin but the skiing is thick. Steep pitches, natural features, and some of the most consistent snow on the mountain.</p>

                    <p><strong>Prospect Bowl:</strong> The intermediate's reward. 440 acres of rolling terrain, gentle glades, and confidence-building runs. Wide groomers let you open up; tree skiing lets you explore. This is where intermediate skiers become advanced.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Meadows:</strong> Beginner paradise in Mountain Village. Gentle terrain, dedicated learning areas, and separation from the more aggressive traffic. If you're learning, you'll spend your days here without feeling in the way.</p>

                    <p><strong>Plunge:</strong> The locals' bump run. Steep, sustained moguls with great snow. No hiking required—just drop off Lift 9 and commit. If you ski bumps, you need to ski Plunge.</p>

                    <h2 id="conditions">Snow and Conditions</h2>

                    <p>Telluride averages 280 inches of snow annually, and the San Juan Mountains have a reputation for quality. The snow here is drier than what you'll find on the Front Range—not quite Utah light, but close.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best months:</strong> January through March for consistent conditions. February typically has the deepest base. Late March and April bring spring skiing—warm days, soft snow, and fewer crowds.</p>

                    <p><strong>Avoid:</strong> Christmas week and Presidents' Day if you hate crowds. These are the busiest periods, though "crowded" at Telluride is still manageable compared to Vail or Breckenridge.</p>

                    <h2 id="tickets">Lift Tickets and Passes</h2>

                    <p>Telluride isn't cheap. Window rates run $200-250+ during peak season. Book online at least a day in advance and you'll save 10-15%.</p>

                    <p><strong>Epic Pass:</strong> Telluride is on the Epic Pass, which provides unlimited skiing here plus access to Vail, Breckenridge, Park City, and dozens of other resorts. If you're skiing 5+ days across Epic resorts, the pass pays for itself.</p>

                    <p><strong>Epic Day Pass:</strong> For shorter trips, the Epic Day Pass lets you pre-purchase a set number of days at a discount. The more days you buy, the lower the per-day rate.</p>

                    <p><strong>Local tip:</strong> If you're staying multiple days, the Epic Pass almost always beats buying lift tickets individually. Do the math before your trip.</p>

                    <h2 id="base">Telluride vs. Mountain Village</h2>

                    <p>Two base areas, two different vibes. The <a href="/telluride/gondola/">free gondola</a> connects them, so you're never stuck in one place.</p>

                    <p><strong>Historic Telluride:</strong> More character, more restaurants, more nightlife. Victorian buildings line Main Street, and the après-ski scene has local flavor. Stay here if you want walkability and town atmosphere.</p>

                    <p><strong>Mountain Village:</strong> Ski-in/ski-out convenience. Modern condos, slopeside access, and a European-style pedestrian plaza. Stay here if first chair and last run matter more than bar-hopping.</p>

                    <p>Many people prefer staying in Telluride and using the gondola to access the slopes—you get the best of both worlds.</p>

                    <h2 id="comparison">How Telluride Compares</h2>

                    <p><strong>vs. Vail:</strong> Telluride has better expert terrain and far fewer crowds. Vail has more intermediate acreage and easier access from Denver. Telluride wins on scenery; Vail wins on convenience.</p>

                    <p><strong>vs. Aspen:</strong> Comparable luxury, comparable prices. Aspen has four mountains and more dining options. Telluride has tighter community feel and arguably better expert terrain. Both are bucket-list worthy.</p>

                    <p><strong>vs. Breckenridge:</strong> Breckenridge is easier to reach and more affordable. Telluride has better snow, fewer people, and more challenging terrain. Breckenridge is a day trip; Telluride is a destination.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Insider Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Download the trail map.</strong> Telluride's terrain is complex, and cell service is spotty on the mountain. Have the map on your phone before you leave the lodge.</p>

                    <p><strong>Warm up on See Forever.</strong> This groomer off Lift 10 has the best views on the mountain. You'll ski directly toward a wall of 14,000-foot peaks. It's also a good way to get your legs under you before hitting the steeps.</p>

                    <p><strong>Hike Revelation Bowl early.</strong> If you're going into Rev, start your hike by 9am. The bootpack can take 30-45 minutes, and you want to be skiing the good stuff before the sun affects the snow.</p>

                    <p><strong>End at There.</strong> Allred's gets the press, but There at Mountain Village has better food and a more relaxed vibe for après. Bonus: you can gondola down to Telluride after.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is Telluride good for beginners?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, but it's not the best choice if you're just learning. The Meadows area is excellent for beginners, but you're paying premium prices for terrain you could find at more affordable resorts. Intermediates and above get more value here.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How do I get to Telluride?</h4>
                            <p>Fly into Montrose (65 miles, 90 minutes) or Telluride Regional Airport (6 miles, but weather-dependent). From Denver, it's a 6-hour drive via scenic Highway 145. Most people fly to Montrose and rent a car or arrange a shuttle.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>When is the best time to ski Telluride?</h4>
                            <p>February for deepest snowpack, March for the best weather. January can be cold but offers consistent conditions. Avoid Christmas and Presidents' Day weeks if you want shorter lift lines.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is there night skiing?</h4>
                            <p>No night skiing at Telluride. Lifts typically run 9am-4pm. The free gondola operates until midnight, so you can still move between town and Mountain Village after dark.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How crowded is Telluride?</h4>
                            <p>Less crowded than I-70 resorts. The remote location filters out casual day-trippers. You'll rarely wait more than 5-10 minutes for a lift except during holiday weeks.</p>
