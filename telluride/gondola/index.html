                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Ride time:</strong> 13 minutes. <strong>Cost:</strong> Free, always. <strong>Hours:</strong> 7am-midnight (summer), varies by season. <strong>Capacity:</strong> 8 passengers per cabin. Dogs and bikes welcome.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Telluride gondola isn't just transportation—it's a destination. This 13-minute ride connects historic Telluride to Mountain Village, climbing 1,790 vertical feet with panoramic San Juan Mountain views the entire way. And it's completely free. Year-round, every day, for everyone.</p>

                    <p>It's the only free public gondola in North America. The town made the unusual decision to keep it free when it opened in 1996, and that decision has become one of Telluride's defining features. Whether you're commuting between base areas, heading to dinner, or just riding for the views, the gondola is an experience you shouldn't skip.</p>

                    <h2 id="stations">The Three Stations</h2>

                    <p>The gondola has three stops, and you can get on or off at any of them.</p>

                    <p><strong>Telluride Station (8,725 ft):</strong> Located at the north end of Oak Street in historic Telluride. It's an easy walk from Main Street and most downtown lodging. This is where most visitors start, and where you'll return after dinner in Mountain Village.</p>

                    <p><strong>San Sophia Station (10,540 ft):</strong> The mid-mountain stop that most people pass through without getting off. In winter, it provides ski access. In summer, it's a stunning viewpoint and trailhead. If you want photos without crowds, get off here.</p>

                    <p><strong>Mountain Village Station (9,545 ft):</strong> The upper terminus, steps from hotels, restaurants, and ski lifts. The European-style pedestrian plaza has a different vibe than historic Telluride—more modern, more resort-like. Allred's restaurant is a short walk away if you're looking for sunset cocktails at 10,551 feet.</p>

                    <h2 id="experience">What to Expect</h2>

                    <p>The cabins are enclosed with large windows on all sides. They load continuously, so you rarely wait more than a few minutes. Each cabin holds 8 people, and you might share with strangers during busy times—or have one to yourself on a quiet Tuesday morning.</p>

                    <p>The views are spectacular. As you rise above Telluride, the box canyon reveals itself—13,000-foot peaks on three sides, Bridal Veil Falls in the distance, the historic town shrinking below. Near San Sophia station, you're above treeline with nothing but alpine terrain and sky.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Ride at sunset. The alpenglow on the San Juan peaks is unforgettable, and the gondola runs until midnight in summer. Bring wine.</p>

                    <h2 id="bikes-dogs">Bikes and Dogs</h2>

                    <p>Both are welcome. Mountain bikers use the gondola to access trails from Mountain Village and San Sophia. Road cyclists can create a loop by riding down to Telluride and taking the gondola back up. Just wheel your bike into the cabin—there's room.</p>

                    <p>Dogs ride free, on leash. Many trails at both ends are dog-friendly, making the gondola a practical way to access hiking with your pup. The locals do it constantly.</p>

                    <h2 id="practical">Practical Details</h2>

                    <p><strong>Summer hours:</strong> 7am to midnight, late May through early October. This means you can dine in Mountain Village and gondola back to town well after dark.</p>

                    <p><strong>Winter hours:</strong> 7am to midnight during ski season. The gondola is a legitimate commuter option for people staying in one area and skiing the other.</p>

                    <p><strong>Shoulder seasons:</strong> Reduced hours, sometimes closed for maintenance. Check the Telluride Ski Resort website for current schedules.</p>

                    <p><strong>Weather closures:</strong> High winds can shut down the gondola. It's rare, but it happens. If the wind is howling, have a backup plan for getting between town and Mountain Village (there's a road, though it takes 20 minutes by car).</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Insider Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Sunset rides are magic.</strong> Time it so you're riding as the sun drops behind the peaks. The light on the mountains is worth planning your evening around.</p>

                    <p><strong>Get off at San Sophia.</strong> Most people ride straight through. The mid-station has incredible views and fewer people. In summer, hiking trails lead from here. In winter, it's ski access.</p>

                    <p><strong>Late night rides.</strong> In summer, the gondola runs until midnight. Riding at 11pm, with the stars overhead and the lights of both towns below, is surprisingly memorable.</p>

                    <p><strong>Skip the car entirely.</strong> Between the gondola and the free Galloping Goose bus in town, you don't need a car to explore Telluride. Park once and forget about it.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is the gondola really free?</h4>
                            <p>Yes. No tickets, no passes, no catches. It's funded by local taxes and the ski resort as a public service. It's been free since it opened in 1996.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What if I'm afraid of heights?</h4>
                            <p>The cabins are enclosed, but some sections have significant exposure—especially near San Sophia where you're crossing open terrain high above the ground. If heights are a serious issue, you can drive between Telluride and Mountain Village instead.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How long is the ride?</h4>
                            <p>About 13 minutes from Telluride to Mountain Village. The cabins load continuously, so total time including waiting is usually under 20 minutes.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">

                            <p>Yes. There's storage for skis and boards in the cabins. Many skiers use the gondola to access terrain on both sides of the mountain.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
