                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Town elevation:</strong> 8,750 ft. <strong>Best season:</strong> Late June–September. <strong>Most popular:</strong> Bear Creek Falls (2.4 mi). <strong>Best alpine lake:</strong> Blue Lake (6 mi). Trails accessible from town, no car needed.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Telluride's box canyon setting means world-class hiking starts right from town. No driving required for trails to waterfalls, alpine lakes, and ridgeline views. The elevation demands respect—you're starting at nearly 9,000 feet and climbing from there—but rewards with scenery that rivals anything in the Rockies.</p>

                    <p>The best part? Many of Telluride's signature hikes begin within walking distance of Main Street. Lace up your boots at your hotel and be on a trail in minutes.</p>

                    <h2 id="easy">Easy to Moderate Trails</h2>

                    <p>These hikes are accessible for most fitness levels, though the altitude makes everything harder than the distance suggests. Start slow, drink water, and enjoy the views.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bear Creek Trail (2.4 miles, 1,040 ft gain):</strong> Telluride's most popular hike, and for good reason. The trail starts at the south end of Pine Street and climbs through aspen forest to Bear Creek Falls, an 80-foot cascade you can hear before you see it. Allow 2-3 hours round trip. Start early to beat crowds.</p>

                    <p><strong>Jud Wiebe Trail (3-mile loop, 1,300 ft gain):</strong> The classic Telluride loop with panoramic views of town and the box canyon. Start from Tomboy Road, climb through mixed forest, and descend with the entire valley spread below. Best done in the morning before afternoon clouds build.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cornet Creek Falls (1.5 miles, 500 ft gain):</strong> The overlooked alternative to Bear Creek. Trailhead at the north end of Aspen Street leads to a hidden waterfall with far fewer people. Quick enough to squeeze in before dinner.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bridal Veil Falls Road (3.8 miles, 1,200 ft gain):</strong> Not a trail but a steep 4WD road leading to Colorado's tallest free-falling waterfall at 365 feet. The historic powerhouse at the top still generates electricity. Steep but wide—you won't lose your footing. The falls are visible from town, but hiking up puts you at their base.</p>

                    <h2 id="challenging">Challenging Hikes</h2>

                    <p>These trails require solid fitness, proper gear, and respect for mountain conditions. Start early to avoid afternoon thunderstorms.</p>

                    <p><strong>Blue Lake (6 miles, 2,200 ft gain):</strong> The reward for effort. This alpine lake at 11,000 feet sits beneath Gilpin Peak, its waters an impossible shade of turquoise. Start from the Bridal Veil Falls road and follow signs. The final push is steep, but the payoff—sitting alone at a glacial lake surrounded by 13,000-foot peaks—justifies every step.</p>

                    <p><strong>Hope Lake (6.5 miles, 2,600 ft gain):</strong> One of the most photogenic lakes in the San Juans. Access from Trout Lake (a short drive from Telluride) and hike through wildflower meadows to a lake with dramatic peak reflections. Allow a full day.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bear Creek to Wasatch Trail (11 miles, 3,800 ft gain):</strong> For strong hikers who want a full-day adventure. Extend the Bear Creek Falls trail into La Junta Basin and connect to the Wasatch Trail for ridgeline views and wildflower meadows. Bring plenty of food and water.</p>

                    <h2 id="expert">Expert Terrain</h2>

                    <p>These require mountaineering skills, proper equipment, and experience. Don't attempt them casually.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wilson Peak (12+ miles, 4,300 ft gain):</strong> The iconic 14,017-foot peak visible from Telluride. Yes, it's the mountain on the Coors logo. The standard route involves Class 3 scrambling—exposed moves where a fall could be fatal. Start before dawn, bring a partner, and know what you're doing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Sneffels via Blue Lakes (9 miles, 4,000 ft gain):</strong> Another fourteener accessible from the Telluride area. Technical scrambling near the summit. The approach through Blue Lakes Pass is spectacular even if you don't summit.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Hiking Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Altitude is real.</strong> Telluride sits at 8,750 feet. If you arrived from sea level, take it easy the first day. Drink constantly. The thin air makes everything harder, and altitude sickness is no joke.</p>

                    <p><strong>Start early.</strong> Summer thunderstorms build almost daily, typically between 1-3pm. You want to be off exposed ridges and summits by noon. Morning hikers get better weather and fewer people.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bears live here.</strong> Black bears are common in the San Juans. Make noise on trails, keep food secured, and carry bear spray for backcountry hikes. They're not aggressive but deserve respect.</p>

                    <p><strong>Check trail conditions.</strong> Snow lingers on high trails into July. Alpine lakes may not be fully accessible until mid-summer. The Telluride Visitor Center has current conditions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pack layers.</strong> Even in July, temperatures can swing 30 degrees between trailhead and summit. Rain gear is essential—afternoon showers are the norm, not the exception.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>When is hiking season in Telluride?</h4>
                            <p>Late June through September for most trails. Lower trails (Bear Creek, Jud Wiebe) open earlier. Alpine lakes often hold snow into July. Fall colors peak in late September.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Do I need a car for hiking?</h4>
                            <p>Not for the most popular trails. Bear Creek, Jud Wiebe, Cornet Creek, and Bridal Veil Falls all start from town. A car helps for accessing trailheads like Hope Lake or Blue Lakes Pass.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Are dogs allowed on trails?</h4>
                            <p>Most trails allow dogs on leash. Bear Creek and Jud Wiebe are popular dog hikes. Keep them leashed—there's wildlife, and other hikers deserve consideration.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What should I bring?</h4>
                            <p>Water (more than you think), layers, rain jacket, sunscreen, snacks, and a trail map. Cell service is unreliable in the backcountry. For longer hikes, add bear spray and a first aid kit.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Which hike has the best waterfall?</h4>
                            <p>Bridal Veil Falls is the most impressive—365 feet of free-falling water. Bear Creek Falls is more accessible and has a nice swimming hole at the base (cold).</p>
