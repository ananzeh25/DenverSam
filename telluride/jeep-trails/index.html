                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Season:</strong> Late June–September (snow dependent). <strong>Classic route:</strong> Imogene Pass (Telluride to Ouray). <strong>Most notorious:</strong> Black Bear Road (experts only). <strong>Vehicle required:</strong> High-clearance 4WD with low range. Rentals and guided tours available.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The San Juan Mountains around Telluride offer some of the most dramatic off-road driving in North America. Old mining roads climb to 13,000+ feet, cross knife-edge passes, and descend switchbacks that test both vehicle and driver. These aren't trails for beginners—but for experienced off-roaders, they're bucket-list worthy.</p>

                    <p>The routes connect Telluride to neighboring towns like Ouray and Silverton, making it possible to build multi-day adventures through some of Colorado's most spectacular terrain.</p>

                    <h2 id="imogene">Imogene Pass</h2>

                    <p><strong>Elevation:</strong> 13,114 ft | <strong>Distance:</strong> 17 miles | <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Difficult</p>

                    <p>The classic San Juan crossing. Imogene connects Telluride to Ouray via the second-highest pass road in Colorado. The summit offers 360-degree views of peaks in every direction—on a clear day, it feels like standing on top of the world.</p>

                    <p>The Telluride side climbs through Tomboy, passing mining ruins and alpine meadows. Above treeline, the road narrows and exposure increases. The Ouray descent is steeper and looser, with tighter switchbacks. Most drivers find Telluride-to-Ouray easier than the reverse.</p>

                    <p><strong>Allow 3-4 hours</strong> for the crossing, more if you stop to explore the mining ruins at Tomboy. Combined with a return via Highway 550, it makes a spectacular full-day loop.</p>

                    <h2 id="black-bear">Black Bear Pass</h2>

                    <p><strong>Elevation:</strong> 12,840 ft | <strong>Distance:</strong> 9 miles | <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Extreme</p>

                    <p>One of Colorado's most notorious roads, and the reputation is earned. The summit is scenic but manageable. The descent into Telluride is where Black Bear earns its infamy: a series of tight switchbacks carved into a cliff face, with drop-offs that leave no room for error.</p>

                    <p><strong>One-way only:</strong> The descent section is one-way (downhill toward Telluride). You cannot drive up the switchbacks. This isn't a suggestion—it's mandatory.</p>

                    <p><strong>Not for casual drivers.</strong> Black Bear has claimed vehicles and lives. The switchbacks require precise vehicle placement, and a mistake means tumbling hundreds of feet. Attempt only with an experienced driver, proper vehicle, and ideally a spotter. Many choose guided tours for good reason.</p>

                    <h2 id="other">More Trails</h2>

                    <p><strong>Ophir Pass (11,789 ft, Moderate):</strong> More accessible than Imogene or Black Bear. Connects Telluride to Highway 550 near Silverton. Good introduction to high-altitude Jeep roads without extreme exposure. Stunning fall colors in September.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tomboy Road (11,500 ft, Moderate-Difficult):</strong> Starts right from Telluride and climbs past the Tomboy Mine ruins. Connects to Imogene Pass or can be done as an out-and-back. Historic mining infrastructure along the way.</p>

                    <p><strong>Alta Lakes Road (11,200 ft, Moderate):</strong> Scenic drive to Alta Lakes ghost town. Less technical than the passes, good for photographers. The lakes themselves are picturesque.</p>

                    <p><strong>Last Dollar Road (10,663 ft, Easy):</strong> Connects Telluride to Highway 62 near Ridgway. Passable by most vehicles in good weather. Famous for fall aspen viewing—possibly the best autumn drive in Colorado.</p>

                    <h2 id="practical">Practical Info</h2>

                    <p><strong>When trails open:</strong> Depends on snowmelt. Ophir and Last Dollar usually open by late June. Imogene and Black Bear may not clear until July. Check conditions before heading out—San Juan County often posts updates.</p>

                    <p><strong>Vehicle requirements:</strong> High-clearance 4WD with low-range gearing for Imogene and Black Bear. AWD crossovers won't cut it. Full-size SUVs, Jeeps, and trucks with proper clearance are the minimum. Ophir and Last Dollar are more forgiving.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rentals:</strong> Several Telluride outfitters rent Jeeps and off-road vehicles. Telluride Outside and local rental companies offer both vehicles and guided tours. If you're new to these trails, guided tours are worth the investment.</p>

                    <p><strong>What to bring:</strong> Full tank of gas, water, snacks, warm layers, rain gear, first aid kit, and a charged phone (service is spotty). For remote trails, add recovery gear and consider traveling with a buddy vehicle.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Insider Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Start early.</strong> Afternoon thunderstorms are almost daily in summer. You want to be off the passes by early afternoon. Lightning at 13,000 feet is serious.</p>

                    <p><strong>Check your brakes.</strong> The descents are steep and sustained. Make sure your vehicle's brakes are in good condition before attempting any pass.</p>

                    <p><strong>Imogene makes a great loop.</strong> Drive Telluride to Ouray via Imogene, return on Highway 550 through Silverton. The Million Dollar Highway is paved but equally scenic.</p>

                    <p><strong>Respect the roads.</strong> Stay on designated routes. The alpine terrain is fragile and slow to recover. Don't create new tracks.</p>

                    <p><strong>Know your limits.</strong> These trails demand respect. If a section looks beyond your ability, turn around. There's no shame in discretion, and no recovery truck can reach you quickly at 13,000 feet.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I rent a Jeep in Telluride?</h4>
                            <p>Yes. Several outfitters rent 4WD vehicles. Guided tours are also available—recommended for first-timers on difficult trails. Book in advance during peak summer season.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is Black Bear really that dangerous?</h4>
                            <p>Yes. The switchbacks on the Telluride descent are genuinely hazardous. Vehicles have gone over the edge. Only attempt with extensive off-road experience, proper vehicle, and ideally a spotter.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I do Imogene Pass in a day?</h4>
                            <p>Yes. Plan 5-7 hours including stops and the return via Highway 550. Start early to avoid afternoon storms. It's a full day but very doable.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
