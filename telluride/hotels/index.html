                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Two areas:</strong> Historic Telluride (walkable, character) or Mountain Village (ski-in/ski-out). <strong>Price range:</strong> $300-500/night mid-range, $500-1000+ luxury. <strong>Book ahead:</strong> 6-12 months for ski season and festivals. Free gondola connects both areas.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Telluride offers two distinct lodging experiences. Historic Telluride has Victorian character, walkable restaurants, and Main Street charm. Mountain Village delivers ski-in/ski-out convenience with modern condos and slope access. The <a href="/telluride/gondola/">free gondola</a> connects both in 13 minutes, so you really can't go wrong.</p>

                    <p>The bigger challenge is booking. Peak ski weeks and major festivals sell out months in advance, and prices climb accordingly. Plan early, and consider shoulder seasons if budget matters.</p>

                    <h2 id="telluride-town">Historic Telluride</h2>

                    <p>Downtown Telluride is where you'll find the town's character. Victorian buildings, local restaurants, and the ability to walk everywhere. The trade-off: no ski-in/ski-out, though the gondola gets you to the slopes in 13 minutes.</p>

                    <p><strong>Hotel Telluride:</strong> Boutique hotel at the edge of downtown with mountain views. Complimentary breakfast, rooftop hot tub, and walking distance to both the gondola and Main Street. The balance of quality and location hits right for most visitors.</p>

                    <p><strong>New Sheridan Hotel:</strong> The historic option, dating to 1895. Restored Victorian elegance on Main Street with the Chop House restaurant on-site. You're paying for character as much as amenities. If hotel history matters to you, this is the one.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Victorian Inn:</strong> Budget-friendly by Telluride standards. Basic rooms but excellent Main Street location, hot tub, and free breakfast. Not fancy, but you can't beat the value for the location.</p>

                    <p><strong>Camel's Garden Hotel:</strong> Boutique property near the gondola. Clean, modern rooms with mountain views. Pool and hot tub. Good middle ground between the Victorian options and modern Mountain Village lodging.</p>

                    <h2 id="mountain-village">Mountain Village</h2>

                    <p>If ski-in/ski-out matters, Mountain Village is the answer. Modern condos and hotels with slopeside access, European-style pedestrian plaza, and all the resort amenities. The vibe is different from downtown—polished and purpose-built rather than historic.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Madeline Hotel:</strong> Telluride's premier luxury property. Auberge Resorts Collection with full-service spa, rooftop pool, and ski valet. When you want the best and money isn't the constraint, this is it.</p>

                    <p><strong>Lumiere Hotel:</strong> Luxury ski-in/ski-out suites with full kitchens and fireplaces. More intimate than The Madeline, with impeccable service. The kind of place where they remember your name.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Peaks Resort & Spa:</strong> Full-service resort with spa, pools, and dining. Family-friendly with ski-in access. Conference facilities if you're mixing work and skiing. Less exclusive than Lumiere or Madeline, but more practical for families.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fairmont Heritage Place:</strong> Premium residence club with hotel services. Spacious apartments with concierge and ski valet. Perfect for families or groups who want space and service combined.</p>

                    <h2 id="rentals">Vacation Rentals</h2>

                    <p>For groups, families, or longer stays, vacation rentals often make more sense than hotels. Full kitchens save on restaurant bills, and you get more space per dollar.</p>

                    <p><strong>Condos:</strong> Mountain Village has extensive condo inventory, much of it ski-in/ski-out. Studios to multi-bedroom units managed by local property companies. Quality varies, so read reviews carefully.</p>

                    <p><strong>Private homes:</strong> VRBO and Airbnb have properties throughout Telluride and Mountain Village. Best for groups splitting costs. Many have hot tubs and stunning views. Book far ahead for ski season—the good properties go fast.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cabins:</strong> More secluded options outside town. Best for summer when access roads are clear. Dramatic settings with privacy, but less practical for ski access.</p>

                    <h2 id="decision">How to Decide</h2>

                    <p><strong>Choose Telluride if:</strong> You want walkable restaurants and nightlife, prefer historic character over modern amenities, and don't mind a 13-minute gondola ride to ski.</p>

                    <p><strong>Choose Mountain Village if:</strong> Ski-in/ski-out matters, you prefer modern conveniences, or you're traveling with kids who'll benefit from slopeside access.</p>

                    <p><strong>The gondola connects everything.</strong> This is the key point. Unlike most two-base-area resorts, Telluride's free gondola makes the choice less consequential. Stay in town, dine in Mountain Village, gondola back. It all works.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Booking Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Book early for peak periods.</strong> Christmas week, Presidents' Day, and major festivals require 6-12 months advance booking. Popular properties sell out even earlier.</p>

                    <p><strong>Consider shoulder seasons.</strong> Late November, early December, and late March offer good skiing with lower prices. Summer outside festival weekends is also more affordable.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stay outside town if needed.</strong> Montrose (65 miles), Ridgway (40 miles), and Ouray (50 miles) offer budget alternatives. You'll need a car and lose the late-night atmosphere, but you'll save significantly during peak periods.</p>

                    <p><strong>Parking costs extra.</strong> Many hotels charge $25-50/night for parking. Mountain Village has structured parking. Consider whether you need a car at all once you arrive—the gondola provides great transit.</p>

                        <div class="inline-faq-item">
                            <h4>How much does lodging cost in Telluride?</h4>
                            <p>Comparable to Aspen. Expect $300-500/night for mid-range hotels in ski season, $500-1000+ for luxury. Summer is 30-50% cheaper outside festival weekends. Vacation rentals can be more economical for groups.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="inline-faq-item">
                            <h4>Do I need a car in Telluride?</h4>
                            <p>Not really. The free gondola connects town and Mountain Village. The Galloping Goose bus serves local areas. A car helps for day trips and accessing remote trailheads, but isn't essential for a ski-focused visit.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="inline-faq-item">
                            <h4>Which area is better for families?</h4>
                            <p>Mountain Village for ski-in/ski-out convenience and kid-friendly resort amenities. Telluride town for more dining variety and walkable atmosphere. Both work—it depends on priorities.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="inline-faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I find last-minute lodging?</h4>
                            <p>During peak periods, unlikely. Shoulder seasons and midweek stays offer more flexibility. If you must book last-minute during busy times, check Montrose and Ridgway for availability.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="inline-faq-item">
                            <h4>Are there any budget options?</h4>
                            <p>The Victorian Inn is the most affordable in-town option. Hostels don't really exist. For true budget travel, stay in Montrose or Ridgway and drive in. Or visit during shoulder season when rates drop.</p>
