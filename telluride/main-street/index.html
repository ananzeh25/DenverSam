                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Colorado Avenue, downtown Telluride. <strong>Length:</strong> 12 blocks, ~20 min walk end-to-end. <strong>Status:</strong> National Historic Landmark District. <strong>Highlights:</strong> Victorian architecture, galleries, restaurants, mountain views in every direction.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Colorado Avenue—known locally as Main Street—is the heart of historic Telluride. This National Historic Landmark District preserves Victorian architecture from the town's 1880s mining boom while housing modern galleries, restaurants, and boutiques. With 13,000-foot peaks visible at either end, it might be the most dramatically situated main street in Colorado.</p>

                    <p>The entire downtown is walkable in 20 minutes, but you'll want longer. This isn't a street to rush. Grab coffee, browse the galleries, watch the light change on the mountains. The beauty of Telluride's Main Street is that it rewards slow exploration.</p>

                    <h2 id="history">The History</h2>

                    <p>Telluride boomed in the 1880s when gold was discovered in the surrounding mountains. The town grew fast, and the buildings on Main Street reflect that era: brick facades, ornate cornices, and the optimism of a mining town that believed the wealth would never end.</p>

                    <p>It nearly did end. When the mines closed, Telluride's population dropped to a few hundred. But that decline preserved what other Colorado towns lost to "progress." The Victorian buildings remained because nobody could afford to tear them down and rebuild. Today, that preservation is Telluride's greatest asset.</p>

                    <p>The ski resort arrived in the 1970s, bringing new money but also strict preservation requirements. You'll find high-end restaurants and galleries in buildings that once housed saloons and general stores. The architecture remains; the contents have evolved.</p>

                    <h2 id="landmarks">Historic Landmarks</h2>

                    <p><strong>New Sheridan Hotel (1895):</strong> The grand dame of Main Street. Three-story brick hotel with original Victorian details, Chop House restaurant, and a historic bar worth visiting. This is where celebrities stay during Film Festival.</p>

                    <p><strong>Sheridan Opera House (1913):</strong> Restored opera house hosting concerts, films, and events. The 240-seat venue has incredible acoustics. Check the schedule—catching a show here is a Telluride essential.</p>

                    <p><strong>Telluride Historical Museum (1893):</strong> Housed in the original Miners' Hospital. Mining artifacts, Ute history, and ski heritage. Essential context for understanding how Telluride evolved from mining camp to resort town.</p>

                    <p><strong>San Miguel County Courthouse (1887):</strong> Classic Western courthouse still in active use. Beautiful architecture and a prominent Main Street location. Worth a photo even if your legal record is clean.</p>

                    <h2 id="shopping">Shopping and Galleries</h2>

                    <p>Main Street is entirely locally owned—no chains, no franchises. The result is a collection of boutiques and galleries that feel curated rather than copied.</p>

                    <p><strong>Galleries:</strong> A dozen art galleries feature Western art, contemporary works, and photography. Most welcome browsers, and gallery walks happen during festivals. Telluride Gallery of Fine Art and Slate Gray Gallery are standouts.</p>

                    <p><strong>Outdoor gear:</strong> Jagged Edge and Telluride Sports cover equipment needs, from ski gear to hiking boots. Rentals available for all seasons.</p>

                    <p><strong>Boutiques:</strong> Mountain-chic clothing, jewelry, and home goods. Between the Covers bookshop is a local institution—browse the Colorado section.</p>

                    <p><strong>Souvenirs:</strong> Quality options beyond typical tourist shops. Look for locally made items and Telluride-branded gear that's actually worth wearing.</p>

                    <h2 id="dining">Dining on Main Street</h2>

                    <p>Most of Telluride's <a href="/telluride/restaurants/">restaurants</a> line Main Street or the blocks just off it. The concentration is remarkable for a town of 2,500 people.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fine dining:</strong> 221 South Oak and Chop House offer special occasion meals. Reservations essential during peak seasons.</p>

                    <p><strong>Casual:</strong> Brown Dog Pizza, La Marmotte, and Oak Telluride deliver quality without formality. Easier to walk in, though waits happen on busy nights.</p>

                    <p><strong>Coffee:</strong> Ghost Town Coffee and Baked in Telluride fuel the morning rush. Get there early on ski days.</p>

                    <h2 id="practical">Practical Details</h2>

                    <p><strong>Walking Main Street:</strong> 12 blocks from the gondola to Town Park. Flat terrain, easy walking. Everything in historic Telluride is accessible on foot.</p>

                    <p><strong>Free bus:</strong> The Galloping Goose runs a free shuttle through town. Convenient for tired legs or carrying ski gear.</p>

                    <p><strong>Parking:</strong> Limited street parking. Lots at either end of town. During busy periods, park once and walk—the town is small enough that a car becomes a burden.</p>

                    <p><strong>Views:</strong> Look east for Ajax Peak and Bridal Veil Falls. Look west toward the gondola and San Sophia Ridge. Mountain views frame every block.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Morning light is best for photos.</strong> The mountains catch early sun while Main Street stays in shadow—the combination works beautifully.</p>

                    <p><strong>Town Park anchors the east end.</strong> Festival venue, playground, and picnic areas. Where locals gather on summer evenings.</p>

                    <p><strong>First Friday events.</strong> Gallery walks and extended hours during summer First Fridays. Good way to experience the art scene.</p>

                    <p><strong>Festival weekends transform everything.</strong> During Bluegrass or Film Festival, Main Street becomes a pedestrian zone of energy and crowds. Plan accordingly—or avoid if you prefer quiet.</p>
