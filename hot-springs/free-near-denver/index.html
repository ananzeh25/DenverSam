                        <h2>Free Options Near Denver</h2>
                        <p><strong>Closest Free Soak:</strong> Radium Hot Springs (3 hours) — riverside pools on public land. <strong>Most Scenic:</strong> Conundrum Hot Springs — requires 8.5-mile hike, permits needed. <strong>Easiest Access:</strong> Penny Hot Springs (3 hours) — roadside pools in Glenwood Canyon, limited parking.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Colorado has dozens of natural hot springs bubbling up from the earth. While the famous ones charge $25-40 for admission, several primitive hot springs remain free. The trade-off? No facilities, no lifeguards, sometimes challenging access, and conditions that vary with weather and seasons.</p>

                    <p>Here's what you need to know about soaking for free near Denver.</p>

                    <h2>The Reality of Free Hot Springs</h2>

                    <p>Free hot springs are <strong>not</strong> like resort hot springs. Expect:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No facilities.</strong> No bathrooms, changing rooms, or lockers. Bring everything you need.</li>
                        <li><strong>Variable conditions.</strong> Water temperature and pool quality change with rain, snow, and river levels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Crowds at popular spots.</strong> "Hidden gems" aren't hidden anymore. Weekend afternoons can be packed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Clothing-optional culture.</strong> Many primitive hot springs are traditionally clothing-optional.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pack it out.</strong> No trash cans. Leave no trace principles apply.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If this sounds like more hassle than it's worth, the commercial hot springs are worth the admission fee. But if you're adventurous and flexible, free soaking offers an experience resorts can't replicate.</p>

                    <h2>Free Hot Springs Within Reasonable Distance</h2>

                    <h3>Radium Hot Springs</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 3 hours from Denver<br>
                    <strong>Access:</strong> Short walk from parking</p>

                    <p>Radium is the most accessible free hot springs with decent facilities (meaning: actual pools that hold water). Located on BLM land along the Colorado River, the pools sit in a beautiful canyon setting.</p>

                    <p>The main pool is large enough for 6-8 people and typically runs 100-105°F. Additional smaller pools offer cooler options. The Colorado River is right there for cold plunges between soaks.</p>

                    <p><strong>Getting there:</strong> From Kremmling, head west on Trough Road (County Road 1). The springs are about 15 minutes down this dirt road. Parking is limited — arrive early on weekends.</p>

                    <p><strong>Conditions:</strong> Best in fall through spring when river levels are lower. Summer runoff can flood the pools. The road may be impassable in winter.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tips:</strong> Bring water shoes, a camp chair, and everything you need. The nearest services are in Kremmling. Popular with overnight campers — dispersed camping is allowed on BLM land.</p>

                    <h3>Penny Hot Springs</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 3 hours from Denver (near Glenwood Springs)<br>
                    <strong>Access:</strong> Roadside, walk from parking</p>

                    <p>Penny sits right along the Crystal River, visible from the highway. The pools are formed by rocks along the river's edge, mixing hot spring water with cold river flow. You can adjust temperature by repositioning rocks or moving to different pools.</p>

                    <p>The setting is gorgeous — mountains, river, aspens in fall. The trade-off is that it's no longer secret. Weekend crowds can be significant, and parking along the highway is limited and sometimes problematic.</p>

                    <p><strong>Getting there:</strong> Located on Highway 133 between Carbondale and Marble. Look for cars parked along the road and people in the river below.</p>

                    <p><strong>Conditions:</strong> Best in low water — late summer through winter. Spring runoff makes the pools too cold and can wash them away entirely. The springs rebuild naturally as water drops.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tips:</strong> Early mornings and weekdays are much less crowded. Bring water shoes — the river rocks are slippery. Be respectful of neighbors; this is a residential area.</p>

                    <h3>Conundrum Hot Springs</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 4 hours from Denver + 8.5-mile hike<br>
                    <strong>Access:</strong> Strenuous hike, permit required</p>

                    <p>Conundrum is the most spectacular free hot springs in Colorado — natural pools at 11,200 feet elevation with stunning mountain views. It's also the hardest to reach: an 8.5-mile hike with 2,500 feet of elevation gain.</p>

                    <p>The effort is worth it for the right people. Soaking in natural pools surrounded by peaks, watching stars emerge from a high alpine basin — it's unforgettable. Most visitors camp overnight to make the most of the experience.</p>

                    <p><strong>Permits required:</strong> Camping permits are required May through October and fill up fast. Book through Recreation.gov well in advance. Day-use permits are sometimes available but competitive.</p>

                    <p><strong>Getting there:</strong> The trailhead is outside Aspen. The hike follows Conundrum Creek through beautiful alpine terrain but is long and demanding. Start early.</p>

                    <p><strong>Conditions:</strong> Best June through September when snow has melted. The trail can be muddy in early summer. Afternoon thunderstorms are common — plan accordingly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tips:</strong> This is a backcountry experience. Bring proper hiking gear, plenty of water, and prepare for changing mountain weather. Wildlife (including bears) is active in the area.</p>

                    <h3>South Canyon Hot Springs</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 2.5 hours from Denver<br>
                    <strong>Access:</strong> Short walk from parking</p>

                    <p>Located near Glenwood Springs, South Canyon offers a free alternative to the commercial pools in town. The natural pools sit in a scenic canyon, though they're smaller and more primitive than nearby Penny.</p>

                    <p>Temperatures vary — sometimes perfect, sometimes lukewarm. The experience depends heavily on recent conditions and how other visitors have maintained the rock pools.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tips:</strong> Worth a stop if you're in the Glenwood area, but don't make a special trip. Consider it a free bonus to a Glenwood visit rather than a destination itself.</p>

                    <h2>Hot Springs to Skip</h2>

                    <p><strong>Some "free" hot springs are on private property</strong> and trespassing is not okay, even if blogs say otherwise. Others are genuinely dangerous — too hot, unstable ground, or poor access. Stick to established, legal spots.</p>

                    <p><strong>The famous Hanging Lake area springs</strong> are off-limits. Don't try to access them.</p>

                    <h2>When Free Isn't Worth It</h2>

                    <p>Consider paying for a commercial hot springs when:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>You're traveling with kids (safety, facilities, reliable conditions)</li>
                        <li>Weather is marginal (rain makes primitive pools miserable)</li>
                        <li>You want a guaranteed good experience (commercial springs are consistent)</li>
                        <li>You only have a few hours (commercial springs maximize soak time)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Free hot springs reward flexibility and adventurous spirit. If you show up and conditions are bad, you need a backup plan.</p>
