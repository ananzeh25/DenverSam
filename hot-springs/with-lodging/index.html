                    </div>

                    <p>Staying at a hot springs resort transforms a day trip into a real getaway. You can soak at sunrise before the crowds arrive, again at sunset, and once more before bed. The rhythm of multiple soaking sessions is completely different from a rushed afternoon visit.</p>

                    <p>Here's every Colorado hot springs with on-site lodging, from luxury resorts to rustic cabins.</p>

                    <h2>Hot Springs Resorts with Full Amenities</h2>

                    <h3>Mount Princeton Hot Springs Resort</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 2.5 hours from Denver<br>
                    <strong>Room rates:</strong> $200-450/night</p>

                    <p>Mount Princeton is the most complete hot springs resort in Colorado. Multiple pools, creek-side soaking, a 400-foot waterslide, full-service restaurant, and spa — it's a destination, not just a hot springs.</p>

                    <p>Lodging options range from standard hotel rooms to creekside cabins with private outdoor hot tubs. The Cliffside rooms are the most popular — private balcony soaking tubs with mountain views. Book these months ahead for weekends.</p>

                    <p><strong>What's included:</strong> Overnight guests get unlimited pool access during their stay. That means you can soak as many times as you want without paying the day-use fee ($25-30 for non-guests).</p>

                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Couples wanting private soaking, families looking for activities, anyone who wants resort amenities without sacrificing hot springs authenticity.</p>

                    <p><a href="/hot-springs/mount-princeton-hot-springs/">Full Mount Princeton guide →</a></p>

                    <h3>Glenwood Hot Springs Lodge</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 2.5 hours from Denver<br>
                    <strong>Room rates:</strong> $150-280/night</p>

                    <p>The lodge sits directly adjacent to the world's largest hot springs pool. Step out the door, walk across the courtyard, and you're in the water. The convenience is unbeatable.</p>

                    <p>Room rates include unlimited pool access — a significant value since day passes run $25-35. Stay two nights and the pool access alone nearly pays for itself.</p>

                    <p>The hotel itself is historic but updated, with comfortable rooms and a breakfast restaurant. Location in downtown Glenwood means restaurants and shops are walkable.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Active visitors who want pool time plus Glenwood Adventure Park, families, value-conscious travelers who appreciate the included pool access.</p>

                    <h3>The Springs Resort (Pagosa Springs)</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 5 hours from Denver<br>
                    <strong>Room rates:</strong> $250-400/night</p>

                    <p>Pagosa's premier resort offers 25 different soaking pools terraced along the San Juan River, plus full spa services. The resort feel is upscale — robes, attentive staff, adults-only rooftop pools.</p>

                    <p>Rooms range from standard hotel to luxury suites. All include 24-hour pool access, which is the real draw. Midnight soaks under the stars, sunrise sessions before breakfast — the freedom to come and go makes the experience.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Couples seeking romance, spa enthusiasts, anyone wanting a polished resort experience.</p>

                    <h3>Hot Springs Inn (Pagosa Springs)</h3>

                    <strong>Room rates:</strong> $120-180/night</p>

                    <p>A more affordable option in Pagosa, the Hot Springs Inn offers rooms with private hot tubs on balconies fed by natural geothermal water. Less luxurious than The Springs Resort, but private soaking in your room is a rare find.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Budget-conscious couples, travelers who prioritize private soaking over resort amenities.</p>

                    <h2>Rustic Cabins and Camping</h2>

                    <h3>Strawberry Park Hot Springs</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 3 hours from Denver<br>
                    <strong>Cabin rates:</strong> $165-275/night</p>

                    <p>Strawberry Park's rustic cabins are the most authentic hot springs lodging experience in Colorado. No TV, no wifi, wood-burning stoves for heat. You'll actually disconnect.</p>

                    <p>The cabins sleep 2-6 people and sit in the forest near the hot springs. Guests get 24-hour pool access, including the after-dark clothing-optional sessions. Walking from your cabin to a starlit soak is magical.</p>

                    <p>These cabins book up months in advance, especially for weekends. Planning ahead is essential.</p>

                    <p><strong>Also available:</strong> Covered wagons and train cabooses for more adventurous stays.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Couples seeking romance, nature lovers, anyone craving a digital detox.</p>

                    <p><a href="/hot-springs/strawberry-park-hot-springs/">Full Strawberry Park guide →</a></p>

                    <h3>Orvis Hot Springs</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 5.5 hours from Denver<br>
                    <strong>Room rates:</strong> $150-200/night</p>

                    <p>Orvis offers simple rooms and a camping area adjacent to the clothing-optional hot springs. The vibe is hippie-spiritual — expect drum circles and meditation, not spa treatments.</p>

                    <p>Overnight guests get 24-hour pool access. The pools are quietest late at night and early morning, making stays worthwhile for those who embrace the atmosphere.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Free-spirited travelers, those comfortable with clothing-optional environments.</p>

                    <h3>Valley View Hot Springs</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 3.5 hours from Denver<br>
                    <strong>Camping:</strong> $30-40/night (members only)</p>

                    <p>Valley View operates as a private club with membership requirements. The natural pools on the mountainside offer solitude you won't find elsewhere. Camping is primitive — no RV hookups, limited facilities.</p>

                    <p>Membership fees are reasonable, and the experience is unlike commercial hot springs. Clothing-optional, crowd-free, and genuinely natural.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Naturists, solitude seekers, return visitors willing to commit to membership.</p>

                    <h2>Luxury Options</h2>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 6 hours from Denver<br>

                    <p>A restored ghost town turned luxury resort, Dunton is Colorado's most exclusive hot springs experience. Only about 40 guests at a time, private cabins, gourmet meals, premium bar, all activities included.</p>

                    <p>The bathhouse is a log cabin with natural hot spring pools inside. Private outdoor tubs sit next to select cabins. The isolation is total — no cell service, nowhere to go, nothing to do but relax.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Special occasions, those with significant budgets, couples seeking ultimate privacy and luxury.</p>

                    <h2>Hotels Near Hot Springs (Not On-Site)</h2>

                    <p>If the hot springs you want doesn't have lodging, here are nearby options:</p>

                    <p><strong>Iron Mountain Hot Springs:</strong> Hotels in Glenwood Springs are 5 minutes away. The Hotel Colorado and Hotel Denver are historic, walkable options.</p>

                    <p><strong>Indian Hot Springs:</strong> The historic bathhouse has basic rooms, but Idaho Springs offers better hotels. The Argo Inn is a good choice.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ouray Hot Springs:</strong> The town of Ouray has charming hotels within walking distance. Box Canyon Lodge has private soaking tubs.</p>

                    <h2>Booking Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Book early for weekends.</strong> Popular cabins at Strawberry Park and Mount Princeton book 2-3 months ahead for Friday/Saturday stays.</p>

                    <p><strong>Weekdays are easier.</strong> You can often book Tuesday or Wednesday stays just a week or two out.</p>

                    <p><strong>Winter requires flexibility.</strong> Weather can close mountain roads. Have backup plans and book refundable rates when possible.</p>

                    <p><strong>Check what's included.</strong> Some lodging includes pool access, others charge separately. Factor this into price comparisons.</p>
