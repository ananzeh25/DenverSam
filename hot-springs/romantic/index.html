                    </div>

                    <p>Hot springs and romance go together naturally. Steam rising into mountain air, warm water under starry skies, no phones buzzing — it's the kind of experience that makes couples actually talk to each other again. Here are the most romantic hot springs near Denver for your next getaway.</p>

                    <h2>The Most Romantic Options</h2>

                    <h3>Strawberry Park Hot Springs — Most Romantic Overall</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 3 hours from Denver</p>

                    <p>Strawberry Park is the most romantic hot springs in Colorado, full stop. Natural stone pools tucked into the forest, no bright lights, no waterslides, no crowds of screaming kids — just steam and stars and the sound of Strawberry Creek.</p>

                    <p>After dark, Strawberry Park becomes clothing-optional and adults-only (18+). This isn't awkward — it's liberating. Most couples describe it as surprisingly natural once you're in the water. The lack of swimsuits adds to the intimacy without feeling weird.</p>

                    <p>The rustic cabins on-site are perfect for a weekend escape. No TV, limited cell service, wood-burning stoves. You'll actually disconnect. Book months ahead for weekend stays — they fill up fast.</p>

                    <p><strong>Romance tips:</strong> Visit on a weeknight for fewer people. Full moon nights are magical but crowded. Bring a bottle of wine (discreet containers only) and snacks. The dirt road requires 4WD in winter, which adds to the adventure.</p>

                    <h3>Mount Princeton Hot Springs — Best Private Soaking</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 2.5 hours from Denver</p>

                    <p>Mount Princeton offers something most Colorado hot springs don't: private hot springs pools in your cabin. The Cliffside rooms and creekside cabins come with outdoor soaking tubs fed by natural geothermal water. You can soak under the stars without sharing space with anyone.</p>

                    <p>Even without a private pool, the creek-side hot springs are romantic. Hot water bubbles up through the creek bed, mixing with cold mountain water. Find a spot, build a little rock dam, and create your own private pool.</p>

                    <p>The resort atmosphere is upscale but not stuffy. Good restaurant, spa services, beautiful mountain views. It's the kind of place where you can do absolutely nothing and feel great about it.</p>

                    <p><strong>Romance tips:</strong> Book a Cliffside room with private pool. Request a room away from the main lodge for more privacy. Sunrise soaks in your private tub are unforgettable.</p>

                    <h3>Iron Mountain Hot Springs — Best Adults-Only</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 2.5 hours from Denver</p>

                    <p>Iron Mountain is strictly 16+ — no kids, ever. The result is a peaceful, grown-up atmosphere that's perfect for couples. Sixteen different pools sit along the Colorado River, each with slightly different temperatures and views.</p>

                    <p>Unlike the party atmosphere at some hot springs, Iron Mountain attracts couples and friends looking for genuine relaxation. Conversations happen at a murmur. The river views are stunning, especially at sunset when the light hits the canyon walls.</p>

                    <p>This is the hot springs equivalent of a nice restaurant versus a family diner. Same basic idea, completely different experience.</p>

                    <p><strong>Romance tips:</strong> Sunset sessions are the most romantic — book ahead for popular times. The whisper-quiet atmosphere means this isn't the place for loud catching up. Combine with dinner in Glenwood Springs for a full date night.</p>

                    <h3>Dunton Hot Springs — Ultimate Luxury</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 6 hours from Denver</p>

                    <p>If money is no object, Dunton is the most romantic hot springs experience in Colorado. This restored ghost town turned luxury resort charges $1,500+ per night — and couples who visit say it's worth every penny.</p>

                    <p>The main bathhouse is a log cabin with natural hot spring pools inside. Private outdoor tubs sit next to your cabin. The entire property accommodates only about 40 guests total, so you'll never feel crowded.</p>

                    <p>Everything is included: gourmet meals, premium drinks, guided adventures, spa treatments. The isolation is complete — you're in a remote mountain valley with no cell service and nothing to do but relax together.</p>

                    <p><strong>Romance tips:</strong> This is anniversary or proposal territory. Book well in advance. The all-inclusive nature means you truly don't have to think about anything. Winter visits offer the most dramatic contrast between cold air and hot water.</p>

                    <h3>Orvis Hot Springs — Clothing-Optional Intimacy</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 5.5 hours from Denver</p>

                    <p>Orvis is clothing-optional at all times — not just after dark like Strawberry Park. For couples comfortable with that, it offers an intimate, unpretentious soaking experience. The small resort has multiple natural pools at different temperatures.</p>

                    <p>The vibe is hippie-spiritual rather than resort-polished. Drum circles happen. People meditate in the pools. It's weird in the best possible way, and couples who are into that energy find it deeply romantic.</p>

                    <p>This isn't for everyone. If the clothing-optional aspect makes you uncomfortable, skip it. But for open-minded couples, Orvis offers something unique.</p>

                    <p><strong>Romance tips:</strong> Overnight stays include 24-hour pool access. Weeknights are quieter than weekends. The outdoor pools have the best mountain views.</p>

                    <h3>The Springs Resort — Spa Luxury in Pagosa</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 5 hours from Denver</p>

                    <p>Pagosa Springs claims the world's deepest geothermal hot springs, and The Springs Resort channels that water into 25 different pools terraced along the San Juan River. The setup is resort-polished with robes, lockers, and attentive staff.</p>

                    <p>For couples who want hot springs without roughing it, this hits the sweet spot. Full spa services mean you can get couples massages before or after soaking. The riverside pools offer mountain views without the mountain drive time of more remote options.</p>

                    <p><strong>Romance tips:</strong> Book a room at the resort for 24-hour pool access. The adults-only rooftop pools are the most romantic spots. Sunset over the San Juan mountains from the upper pools is spectacular.</p>

                    <h2>Planning a Romantic Hot Springs Trip</h2>

                    <p><strong>Best time for romance:</strong> Winter and early spring offer the most dramatic experience — steam rising into cold air, snow on surrounding peaks, longer soaking sessions. Summer is beautiful but more crowded.</p>

                    <p><strong>Weekday vs. weekend:</strong> Weekday visits are dramatically less crowded at every hot springs. If you can swing it, Tuesday or Wednesday trips offer the most intimate experiences.</p>

                    <p><strong>Evening sessions:</strong> Most romantic hot springs get better after dark. Stars, steam, and the intimacy of night transform the experience. Many places offer extended evening hours or overnight access for guests.</p>

                    <p><strong>Make it an overnight:</strong> Day trips work, but overnight stays let you soak at sunset and sunrise. That multiple-session rhythm — soak, eat, sleep, soak again — is where the magic really happens.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Which Colorado hot springs allow couples to be alone?</h4>
                            <p>Mount Princeton offers cabins with private outdoor soaking tubs. Dunton Hot Springs has private pools for guests. For true solitude, these are your best options — public hot springs always have other people around, even during quiet times.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Are clothing-optional hot springs awkward for couples?</h4>
                            <p>Most couples say it's surprisingly comfortable once you get in the water. Strawberry Park after dark and Orvis are the main clothing-optional options. The vibe is respectful and natural, not voyeuristic. If you're curious but nervous, Strawberry Park at dusk is a good introduction — swimsuits required until dark, then optional.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can you drink alcohol at hot springs?</h4>
                            <p>Most Colorado hot springs don't allow alcohol in pools. Some (like Strawberry Park) allow discreet containers. Iron Mountain has an on-site bar but prohibits drinks in pools. Check individual policies — and remember that alcohol plus hot water plus altitude hits hard.</p>
