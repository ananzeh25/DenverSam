                    </div>

                    <p>Not all Colorado hot springs work for families. Some are too hot for little ones, others are adults-only, and a few have pools so deep that young kids can't touch bottom. After testing these with actual children, here's what you need to know.</p>

                    <h2>The Top Picks for Families</h2>

                    <h3>Mount Princeton Hot Springs — Best Overall for Families</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 2.5 hours from Denver</p>

                    <p>Mount Princeton is the gold standard for family hot springs trips. The 400-foot waterslide keeps older kids entertained for hours while younger ones play in the shallow areas. The creek-side pools offer a unique experience — hot springs bubble up through the creek bed, mixing with cold water so kids can find their perfect temperature.</p>

                    <p>Multiple pool temperatures mean you can move around as kids get hot or cold. The main pool stays around 95-98°F — comfortable enough for extended play without overheating little bodies.</p>

                    <p><strong>Family tips:</strong> Book a cabin and make it an overnight trip. Mornings are quieter. The on-site restaurant saves you from hungry kid meltdowns. Bring water shoes for the creek pools — the rocks are slippery.</p>

                    <h3>Indian Hot Springs — Closest Family Option</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 45 minutes from Denver</p>

                    <p>The tropical dome pool at Indian Hot Springs works well for families with kids who actually want to swim, not just soak. The temperature (90-100°F) is warm but not too hot for children. It's the closest real hot springs to Denver, making it perfect for a half-day trip.</p>

                    <p>The geothermal caves are hit-or-miss with kids. Some love the adventure of exploring dark, steamy underground chambers. Others find them too hot or too dark. Test your kid's tolerance for heat and enclosed spaces before committing to cave tickets.</p>

                    <p><strong>Family tips:</strong> Skip the caves for kids under 8 unless they're particularly adventurous. The dome pool alone is worth the trip. Combine with lunch in Idaho Springs — the historic downtown has family-friendly restaurants.</p>

                    <h3>Glenwood Hot Springs — Best for Active Kids</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 2.5 hours from Denver</p>

                    <p>Glenwood claims the world's largest hot springs pool — and it's big enough that kids can actually swim laps, play games, and burn energy. This isn't a quiet soak; it's more like a giant warm swimming pool.</p>

                    <p>The main pool stays around 90-93°F, which is the sweet spot for active kids who'd overheat in hotter water. Glenwood Adventure Park is right next door with alpine coaster and other rides, making this an easy full-day family destination.</p>

                    <p><strong>Family tips:</strong> Stay at the lodge for unlimited pool access. Weekdays are significantly less crowded than weekends. The therapy pool (104°F) is too hot for young kids — stick to the main pool.</p>

                    <h3>Ouray Hot Springs Pool — Best Value</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 5.5 hours from Denver</p>

                    <p>Ouray's renovated municipal pool has a dedicated kids' section with shallow water and appropriate temperatures. At $12 for children (under 17), it's the best value among major Colorado hot springs. The mountain views are spectacular — 13,000-foot peaks surround the pool on all sides.</p>

                    <p>This is a serious drive from Denver, so plan for a weekend trip. The town of Ouray is charming, with ice cream shops and easy hiking trails that kids enjoy.</p>

                    <p><strong>Family tips:</strong> Combine with the San Juan Skyway drive. Stay in town — several hotels offer hot springs packages. The adults-only section is separate, so parents can take turns soaking in the hotter pools.</p>

                    <h3>Strawberry Park Hot Springs — Daytime Only</h3>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> 3 hours from Denver</p>

                    <p>Strawberry Park welcomes families during daytime hours. The natural stone pools and rustic forest setting create a different experience than resort-style hot springs. Kids who appreciate nature will love it.</p>

                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Strawberry Park becomes clothing-optional and adults-only (18+) after dark. Plan your visit for daytime only when traveling with children. Swimsuits are required during family hours.</p>

                    <p><strong>Family tips:</strong> Arrive early and leave by late afternoon. Bring snacks — options on-site are limited. The dirt road in winter requires 4WD (by law), which can be part of the adventure for kids.</p>

                    <h2>Hot Springs to Avoid with Kids</h2>

                    <p><strong>Iron Mountain Hot Springs:</strong> Adults-only (16+). No exceptions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Orvis Hot Springs:</strong> Clothing-optional at all times. Not appropriate for families.</p>

                    <p><strong>Dunton Hot Springs:</strong> Luxury resort with adult-oriented atmosphere and prices ($1,000+ per night). Not designed for families.</p>

                    <p><strong>Strawberry Park after dark:</strong> Clothing-optional, adults-only after sundown.</p>

                    <h2>Tips for Hot Springs with Kids</h2>

                    <p><strong>Watch for overheating.</strong> Kids overheat faster than adults in hot water. Keep sessions short (15-20 minutes), take breaks, and watch for red faces or complaints of feeling too hot.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bring plenty of water.</strong> Hot water + altitude = dehydration fast. Pack water bottles and insist kids drink regularly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Time it right.</strong> Early morning or late afternoon works best. Midday sun plus hot water is too much for little ones.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pack snacks.</strong> Hungry kids after swimming is a guaranteed meltdown. Have snacks ready in the car or bring them poolside where allowed.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bring water shoes.</strong> Pool decks and natural rock surfaces can be slippery. Water shoes prevent falls and make walking between pools easier.</p>

                    <p><strong>Lower your expectations.</strong> A "relaxing soak" with kids isn't relaxing. Embrace the chaos, play with them, and save the peaceful adult soak for another trip.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What age can kids go to hot springs?</h4>
                            <p>Most Colorado hot springs allow children of all ages during daytime hours. However, doctors recommend limiting time in hot water for babies and toddlers. The 90-95°F pools are safest for young children — avoid the 104°F+ therapy pools with kids under 12.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Are hot springs safe for toddlers?</h4>
                            <p>Toddlers can visit hot springs, but keep sessions very short (5-10 minutes), stay in cooler pools (under 100°F), and watch closely for overheating. Never leave toddlers unattended near any pool. The cooler main pools at Glenwood and Mount Princeton are the safest options.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Which Colorado hot springs have waterslides?</h4>
                            <p>Mount Princeton Hot Springs has a 400-foot waterslide. Glenwood Hot Springs has smaller slides in the main pool. Most other Colorado hot springs focus on soaking rather than water park features.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can you bring pool toys to hot springs?</h4>
                            <p>Policies vary. Glenwood and Mount Princeton generally allow basic pool toys during off-peak hours. Natural hot springs like Strawberry Park typically don't allow toys. Call ahead to confirm.</p>
