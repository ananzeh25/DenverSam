                    <p>Looking for a Denver hotel with an actual fireplace in the room? Not the fake electric kind that hums and glows orange—a real fireplace where you can watch actual flames and justify ordering room service instead of going out in the cold.</p>

<p>These five hotels deliver on that specific romantic vibe, but they're all different enough that your choice depends on what else matters beyond the fireplace. This guide covers what each hotel actually offers, what the rooms are like, what you're paying for, and which one makes sense for different situations.</p>

<h2  id="brown-palace">The Brown Palace Hotel and Spa (The Historic Luxury Option)</h2>

<p><strong>Address:</strong> <a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=321+17th+St,+Denver,+CO+80202" target="_blank" rel="noopener">321 17th St, Denver, CO 80202</a><br><strong>Phone:</strong> <a href="tel:+13032973111">(303) 297-3111</a><br><strong>Price Range:</strong> $300-600+ per night<br><strong>Parking:</strong> Valet only, $55/night</p>

<p>The Brown Palace has been Denver's fancy hotel since 1892. It's where presidents stay, where locals take out-of-town guests for fancy drinks, and where you go for old-school luxury. The fireplace suites are actual suites with sitting areas, historic details, and that feeling of being somewhere important.</p>

<p>The building itself is stunning—eight-story atrium with stained glass ceiling. Afternoon tea service is legitimately good (not just touristy). The Ship Tavern bar is a Denver institution. Location is perfect—downtown, walking distance to 16th Street Mall, performing arts, restaurants.</p>

<p>Fireplace suites book fast for weekends, especially winter. The fireplaces are wood-burning (real but requires fire management). The spa is professional and expensive. Bottom line: premium luxury at premium prices—worth it for special occasions, probably overkill for casual weekends.</p>

</div>

<ul>
<li>Best for: Special occasions, anniversary trips, impressing someone</li>
<li>Skip if: You're on a budget or prefer modern over historic</li>
<li>Booking tip: Fireplace suites are limited—book at least 2-3 weeks ahead for weekends</li>
<li>Parking reality: $55/night valet is your only option, factor this into your budget</li>
<li>Restaurant: Ellyngton's for breakfast/brunch, Ship Tavern for drinks</li>
</ul>

<div class="ds-highlight-box">
<p><strong>Real Talk:</strong> The Brown Palace is expensive and they know it. Service is excellent but you're paying premium prices for everything—parking, room service, drinks. It's worth it for special occasions but probably overkill for a casual weekend.</p>

<h2  id="oxford-hotel">The Oxford Hotel (The Boutique Downtown Choice)</h2>

<p><strong>Address:</strong> <a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=1600+17th+St,+Denver,+CO+80202" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1600 17th St, Denver, CO 80202</a><br><strong>Phone:</strong> <a href="tel:+13036285400">(303) 628-5400</a><br><strong>Price Range:</strong> $200-400+ per night<br><strong>Parking:</strong> Valet $45/night, or use Union Station parking across the street</p>

<p>The Oxford is right across from Union Station—built in 1891 with historic boutique hotel vibes but more intimate than the Brown Palace. The fireplace rooms are cozier, not massive suites, but well-designed spaces where the fireplace actually belongs.</p>

<p>Union Station location is clutch for walking to restaurants, bars, and light rail to the airport. The Cruise Room bar is Art Deco and serves strong martinis—a Denver landmark worth visiting. McCormick's Fish House (hotel restaurant) is solid for seafood.</p>

<p>Rooms are smaller than modern hotels (historic building constraints). The fireplace rooms have gas fireplaces—easy on/off, no wood management. Spa isn't on-site but they partner with nearby spa. Slightly lower prices than Brown Palace while keeping historic character.</p>

</div>

<ul>
<li>Best for: Couples who want downtown access, historic charm without pretension</li>
<li>Skip if: You need lots of room space or prefer ultra-modern hotels</li>
<li>Booking tip: Ask for upper floors for less street noise from Union Station</li>
<li>Parking hack: Union Station parking garage is $25/day—cheaper than valet</li>
<li>Restaurant: Cruise Room for pre-dinner drinks, then walk to nearby restaurants</li>
</ul>

<div class="ds-highlight-box">
<p><strong>Location Advantage:</strong> Being next to Union Station means easy light rail access to/from the airport. Skip rental car costs entirely if you're just doing a city weekend. Walk or Uber everywhere else.</p>
</div>

</style>

<h2  id="jacquard">The Jacquard, Autograph Collection (The Upscale Modern Option)</h2>

<p><strong>Address:</strong> <a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=1590+Wynkoop+St,+Denver,+CO+80202" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1590 Wynkoop St, Denver, CO 80202</a><br><strong>Phone:</strong> <a href="tel:+17203408888">(720) 340-8888</a><br><strong>Price Range:</strong> $250-500+ per night<br><strong>Parking:</strong> Valet $50/night, self-park $40/night</p>

<p>The Jacquard opened in 2018—modern design, larger rooms, better amenities than historic hotels. The fireplace suites have gas fireplaces with actual design integration. Floor-to-ceiling windows in many rooms, mountain views on the right building side.</p>

<p>Location is LoDo near Union Station but slightly quieter. Walking distance to Coors Field, downtown restaurants, bars. The rooftop bar (Departure) has good cocktails, decent food, city and mountain views. Gets packed summer evenings—reservations help.</p>

<p>Rooms are larger and more modern than The Oxford or Brown Palace. If you prefer new hotels over historic charm, this is your choice. Marriott affiliation means you can use points. Service is professional but less personal than boutique hotels.</p>

<div class="instagram-embed-container">

</div>

<ul>
<li>Best for: People who want modern luxury, rooftop access, larger rooms</li>
<li>Skip if: You prefer historic character or small boutique hotels</li>
<li>Booking tip: Request mountain-view rooms when booking (south/west facing)</li>
<li>Parking: Self-park is available and saves $10/night vs valet</li>
<li>Restaurant: Departure rooftop for drinks/dinner, tons of options within walking distance</li>
</ul>

<div class="ds-highlight-box">
<p><strong>Marriott Bonvoy:</strong> This is part of Marriott's Autograph Collection. If you have status or points, this is the fireplace hotel where they'll actually matter. The others are independent or different chains.</p>

</style>

<h2  id="crawford-hotel">The Crawford Hotel (The Union Station Experience)</h2>

<p><strong>Address:</strong> <a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=1701+Wynkoop+St,+Denver,+CO+80202" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1701 Wynkoop St, Denver, CO 80202</a><br><strong>Phone:</strong> <a href="tel:+17204603700">(720) 460-3700</a><br><strong>Price Range:</strong> $250-450+ per night<br><strong>Parking:</strong> Union Station parking garage, $25/day</p>

<p>The Crawford is literally inside Union Station—hotel rooms built into the historic train station building. Each room is uniquely designed because they're working with existing architecture. Some have train platform views, others overlook the main hall. This is either extremely cool or slightly weird depending on your perspective.</p>

<p>The fireplace rooms vary significantly. Because of building constraints, not all are equal—some are spacious suites with great fireplaces, others feel cramped with the fireplace squeezed in. Ask specific questions about room layout when booking or look at photos of your exact room type.</p>

<p>Location advantages are massive—immediate access to restaurants (Mercantile Dining, Snooze, Cooper Lounge), bars, shops, and light rail to the airport. You can walk downstairs to catch a train. The quirk factor: you'll hear train announcements occasionally. Some love this, others find it annoying. No on-site spa or major amenities because space is limited.</p>

<ul>
<li>Best for: Unique experiences, car-free weekends, train/architecture enthusiasts</li>
<li>Skip if: You want a traditional hotel feel or absolute quiet</li>
<li>Booking tip: Request specific room details when booking—they vary significantly</li>
<li>Parking: Use Union Station garage ($25/day) instead of hotel valet</li>
<li>Restaurant: Walk downstairs to Union Station restaurants, all are solid options</li>
</ul>

<div class="ds-highlight-box">
<p><strong>Noise Factor:</strong> Some rooms are quieter than others. If you're a light sleeper, specifically request a room away from the main hall and train platforms. The hotel knows which rooms are quieter.</p>
</div>

.ds-highlight-box { padding: 12px 16px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; font-size: 0.95rem; background: #fff3cd; margin: 20px 0; }

<h2  id="art-hotel">The ART Hotel (The Creative/Hip Option)</h2>

<p><strong>Address:</strong> <a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=1201+Broadway,+Denver,+CO+80203" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1201 Broadway, Denver, CO 80203</a><br><strong>Phone:</strong> <a href="tel:+13035728000">(303) 572-8000</a><br><strong>Price Range:</strong> $180-350+ per night<br><strong>Parking:</strong> Self-park $35/night</p>

<p>The ART Hotel is on Broadway in the Golden Triangle neighborhood—Denver's arts district. You're near museums (Denver Art Museum, Clyfford Still Museum) and galleries with a different vibe than the business district. Good for people who want culture without being in thick tourist/business Denver.</p>

<p>The hotel leans into art themes—rotating installations, creative design, rooms that feel like lofts not traditional hotel rooms. The fireplace rooms continue this aesthetic—modern, artistic, designed intentionally rather than just "we added a fireplace." The rooftop bar (FIRE) has good views, fire pits, decent cocktails, less crowded than famous downtown rooftop bars.</p>

<p>Broadway location means you're near restaurants but not walking-distance to as many options as downtown hotels. It's more residential/local around here. Good if you want less touristy vibes, less convenient if you want everything outside your door. Pricing is slightly lower than downtown options, especially weekdays. Easy Uber/Lyft access anywhere in Denver.</p>

</div>

<ul>
<li>Best for: Art/museum lovers, people who want slightly lower prices, unique vibe</li>
<li>Skip if: You want to be in the center of downtown action</li>
<li>Booking tip: Rooftop rooms have better city/mountain views</li>
<li>Parking: Self-park is available and cheaper than most downtown hotels</li>
<li>Restaurant: FIRE rooftop for drinks, walk to nearby Broadway restaurants</li>
</ul>

<div class="ds-highlight-box">
<p><strong>Museum District Access:</strong> You're walking distance to Denver Art Museum, History Colorado Center, and Clyfford Still Museum. Good for culture-focused weekends where you actually want to do stuff during the day.</p>

</style>

<h2  id="comparison">Which Hotel Actually Makes Sense?</h2>

<p>All five have fireplaces, so the real question is what else matters:</p>

<p><strong>Choose Brown Palace if:</strong> Money isn't the main concern, you want traditional luxury, it's a special occasion, and you value historic significance over modern amenities.</p>

<p><strong>Choose Oxford Hotel if:</strong> You want boutique character, prefer Union Station access, value walkability, and want slightly lower prices than Brown Palace while keeping the historic vibe.</p>

<p><strong>Choose Jacquard if:</strong> You prefer modern over historic, want larger rooms, care about rooftop access, or have Marriott points to burn.</p>

<p><strong>Choose Crawford if:</strong> The Union Station experience appeals to you, you're doing a car-free weekend, uniqueness matters more than traditional hotel amenities.</p>

<p><strong>Choose ART Hotel if:</strong> You want something creative and different, plan to visit museums anyway, prefer slightly lower prices, and don't need to be in the center of downtown.</p>

<h2  id="practical-tips">Practical Tips for Romantic Hotel Stays</h2>

<p><strong>Booking Timing:</strong> Fireplace rooms are limited at all these hotels—book 2-4 weeks ahead for weekends, especially October-February. Not all "fireplace rooms" are equal (gas vs wood-burning, suites vs regular rooms with fireplace added). Ask specific questions when booking or you might be disappointed.</p>

<p><strong>Parking Reality:</strong> Downtown Denver hotel parking is expensive ($35-55/night). Factor this into your budget or consider car-free weekends using light rail plus Uber/Lyft. The Oxford, Jacquard, and Crawford are best positioned for car-free stays.</p>

<p><strong>Peak Season Pricing:</strong> October-February are peak fireplace season with higher rates. Brown Palace and Oxford run romance packages with champagne, chocolates, spa credits—sometimes good value, sometimes overpriced. Do the math before booking. Summer fireplace rooms might be cheaper but you probably won't use the fireplace much.</p>

<ul>
<li>Best overall value: Oxford Hotel (good balance of character, location, price)</li>
<li>Best splurge: Brown Palace (if money doesn't matter, go big)</li>
<li>Best modern option: Jacquard (newest, largest rooms, good amenities)</li>
<li>Most unique: Crawford (the train station experience is one-of-a-kind)</li>
<li>Best for museum lovers: ART Hotel (location in arts district is key)</li>
</ul>

<h2  id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts on Denver Fireplace Hotels</h2>

<p>The fireplace is a nice touch but it's not the whole experience. All five hotels deliver on the fireplace promise, but they're dramatically different in every other way—historic vs modern, downtown vs arts district, boutique vs branded.</p>

<p>Brown Palace is the classic choice (expensive, impressive). Oxford gives you similar history with more character. Jacquard is for people who prefer modern luxury. Crawford is for people who want something different. ART Hotel is for creatives who value interesting over traditional.</p>

<p>None are bad choices. The worst outcome is picking one that doesn't match your preferences and spending a romantic weekend annoyed you didn't book the other place. Book ahead, ask specific questions about room layout, factor in parking costs ($35-55/night), and set realistic expectations. Know what matters to you beyond the fireplace and pick accordingly.</p>
