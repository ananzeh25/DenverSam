                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Elevation:</strong> 14,115 feet. <strong>Ways up:</strong> Pikes Peak Highway (drive), Cog Railway (train), Barr Trail (hike). <strong>Famous for:</strong> "America the Beautiful" inspiration, high-altitude donuts. <strong>Reservations:</strong> Required for highway and railway in peak season.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Pikes Peak is called "America's Mountain" for good reason. When Katharine Lee Bates reached the summit in 1893, she was inspired to write "America the Beautiful"—the purple mountain majesties are real, and they're visible from this summit. At 14,115 feet, Pikes Peak isn't Colorado's highest fourteener, but it's the most accessible and arguably the most famous.</p>

                    <p>Unlike most Colorado peaks that require serious mountaineering, Pikes Peak offers three distinct ways to reach the summit: drive the 19-mile Pikes Peak Highway, ride the Broadmoor Manitou and Pikes Peak Cog Railway, or hike the challenging 13-mile Barr Trail. Each offers a different experience, but all deliver the same spectacular payoff at the top.</p>

                    <h2 id="highway">Pikes Peak Highway</h2>

                    <p><strong>The drive</strong> covers 19 miles from the toll gate to the summit, climbing nearly 7,000 feet through multiple ecosystems. The road is paved but includes sharp switchbacks and exposed sections without guardrails. Not recommended for those uncomfortable with heights or mountain driving.</p>

                    <p><strong>Reservations required</strong> during peak season (typically May through September). Book online in advance—same-day availability is limited. The reservation includes your toll fee.</p>

                    <p><strong>Allow 2-3 hours</strong> for the round trip, more if you want to stop at viewpoints and spend time at the summit. There's no rushing this drive—the altitude and road conditions demand careful pace.</p>

                    <p><strong>Vehicle requirements:</strong> Check brake function before ascending. The descent is harder on brakes than the climb. Rangers check brake temperature partway down and may require you to wait if brakes are overheated.</p>

                    <h2 id="railway">Pikes Peak Cog Railway</h2>

                    <p><strong>The experience:</strong> The Broadmoor Manitou and Pikes Peak Cog Railway climbs to the summit on the world's highest cog railway. Completely renovated and reopened in 2021, the new trains offer large windows and comfortable seating for the 9-mile journey.</p>

                    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> About 3 hours total—roughly 70 minutes up, 40 minutes at the summit, and a similar return. The train does the work; you enjoy the views.</p>

                    <p><strong>Departures:</strong> From the Cog Railway Depot in Manitou Springs. Multiple departures daily during peak season, fewer in winter. Reservations essential—trains book up weeks in advance for popular dates.</p>

                    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> No driving stress, narrated journey, guaranteed turnaround time. Good option for those who want the summit experience without the mountain driving.</p>

                    <h2 id="hiking">Barr Trail</h2>

                    <p><strong>The challenge:</strong> 13 miles one way, gaining over 7,800 feet of elevation. This is a serious undertaking—most hikers take 6-8 hours up and 4-5 hours down. It's not technical, but the distance and altitude make it strenuous.</p>

                    <p><strong>Barr Camp</strong> sits at roughly the halfway point, offering bunks and meals for those splitting the hike into two days. Reservations required. Many hikers stay overnight and summit fresh the next morning.</p>

                    <p><strong>Start early:</strong> Most successful summit attempts begin before dawn. Afternoon thunderstorms are common above treeline during summer—you want to be heading down when they develop.</p>

                    <p><strong>Altitude acclimatization:</strong> The trailhead starts at 6,600 feet; you're finishing at 14,115 feet. The altitude affects everyone. Take it slow, hydrate constantly, and be willing to turn back if symptoms of altitude sickness develop.</p>

                    <h2 id="summit">The Summit</h2>

                    <p><strong>Summit House</strong> is a modern facility at the top, opened in 2021. Heated interior with views, restrooms, and the famous donut shop. The donuts are made at altitude with a special recipe—they're a Pikes Peak tradition.</p>

                    <p><strong>The views</strong> extend across the plains to the east and deep into the Rockies to the west. On clear days, you can see Denver and beyond. The curvature of the Earth is visible on the horizon.</p>

                    <p><strong>Altitude effects:</strong> At 14,115 feet, oxygen is about 60% of sea level. Most visitors feel the effects—shortness of breath, lightheadedness, fatigue. Move slowly, don't overexert, and descend if you feel unwell.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Visiting Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Weather changes fast.</strong> The summit can be 30-40 degrees colder than Colorado Springs. Bring layers even on summer days. Wind is almost constant at the top.</p>

                    <p><strong>Book ahead.</strong> Both the highway and railway require reservations during peak season. Last-minute visits may not be possible on popular dates.</p>

                    <p><strong>Morning is best.</strong> Clearer views, less afternoon storm risk, and better photography light. Aim to be at the summit before noon in summer.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Should I drive or take the train?</h4>
                            <p>The train is more relaxing and offers narration. Driving gives flexibility to stop at viewpoints. Both deliver you to the same summit. Choose based on your comfort with mountain driving and desire for flexibility.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I hike partway and turn around?</h4>
                            <p>Absolutely. Many hikers go to Barr Camp (6.5 miles) or partway up for great views without committing to the full summit. Any portion of Barr Trail is worthwhile.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What are the famous donuts about?</h4>
                            <p>The Summit House makes donuts at 14,115 feet using a recipe adjusted for altitude. They've been a Pikes Peak tradition for decades. Try one—they're genuinely good, not just a novelty.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is Pikes Peak open in winter?</h4>
                            <p>The highway closes seasonally (typically after Labor Day through late May). The cog railway operates year-round with reduced schedules. Hiking Barr Trail in winter requires serious mountaineering preparation.</p>
