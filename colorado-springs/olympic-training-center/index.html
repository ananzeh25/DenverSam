                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Admission:</strong> Free tours. <strong>Location:</strong> Downtown Colorado Springs. <strong>Tour length:</strong> About 1 hour. <strong>What you'll see:</strong> Training facilities, athlete dining hall, Olympic memorabilia. <strong>Note:</strong> Athletes may or may not be training during your visit.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Colorado Springs earned the nickname "Olympic City USA" for good reason—it's home to the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Training Center, where American athletes prepare for the Games. Free guided tours offer visitors a behind-the-scenes look at the facilities where wrestlers, swimmers, shooters, and other Olympic hopefuls train at 6,000 feet elevation, building the endurance that pays off at sea-level competitions.</p>

                    <p>The training center opened in 1978 and has hosted generations of Olympic athletes. While training schedules mean you might not see athletes during your visit, the tour provides insight into what it takes to compete at the highest level—the sports science, the facilities, the daily grind that separates Olympians from everyone else.</p>

                    <h2 id="tour">The Tour Experience</h2>

                    <p><strong>Guided tours</strong> depart regularly from the Visitor Center. Former athletes often serve as guides, adding personal perspective to the experience. Tours last approximately one hour and cover the accessible portions of the 35-acre complex.</p>

                    <p><strong>What you'll see:</strong> The tour typically includes the Aquatics Center (Olympic-sized pools), gymnasiums, weight rooms, and the athlete dining hall. You'll learn about training methods, sports science, and the daily life of resident athletes.</p>

                    <p><strong>Athlete sightings:</strong> Not guaranteed. Training schedules vary, and some facilities are off-limits during active training. Summer months and periods leading up to major competitions tend to have more activity. Don't expect autographs or interaction—athletes are working.</p>

                    <p><strong>Reservations:</strong> Tours are free but reservations are recommended, especially during peak tourist season. Walk-ins are accommodated when space allows. Check the Team USA website for current tour schedules.</p>

                    <h2 id="facilities">Training Facilities</h2>

                    <p><strong>Aquatics Center</strong> includes a 50-meter Olympic pool and diving well. U.S. swimming and diving teams train here, taking advantage of the altitude to build endurance.</p>

                    <p><strong>Sports Center</strong> houses indoor courts, wrestling mats, and multi-purpose training spaces. Various sports rotate through depending on training camps and schedules.</p>

                    <p><strong>Shooting Center</strong> provides ranges for Olympic shooting events. Tours may include this facility depending on training schedules.</p>

                    <p><strong>Altitude advantage:</strong> Colorado Springs sits at 6,035 feet. Athletes training here develop increased red blood cell production, which enhances performance when competing at lower elevations. This physiological advantage is a key reason for the training center's location.</p>

                    <h2 id="visitor-center">Visitor Center</h2>

                    <p><strong>Olympic memorabilia</strong> fills the Visitor Center, including medals, torches, equipment, and athlete profiles. The exhibits provide context for the tour and the Olympic movement in America.</p>

                    <p><strong>Team USA Shop</strong> offers official merchandise—a chance to bring home Olympic gear while supporting athlete programs.</p>

                    <p><strong>Photo opportunities</strong> include the Olympic rings and various displays. The flame sculpture outside makes a classic backdrop.</p>

                    <h2 id="practical">Practical Information</h2>

                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> One Olympic Plaza, downtown Colorado Springs. Easy to reach from most city attractions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Parking:</strong> Free parking available on-site. The lot accommodates tour visitors without difficulty.</p>

                    <p><strong>Time needed:</strong> Plan 1.5-2 hours including the tour, Visitor Center exhibits, and gift shop.</p>

                    <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The tour route is wheelchair accessible. Notify staff of accessibility needs when booking.</p>

                    <h2 id="context">Olympic City USA</h2>

                    <p><strong>Beyond the Training Center,</strong> Colorado Springs hosts numerous Olympic governing bodies and sports organizations. The U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee is headquartered here. The city's Olympic identity goes beyond one facility.</p>

                    <p><strong>U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Museum</strong> (separate facility downtown) opened in 2020, offering a more extensive museum experience with interactive exhibits. Worth combining with the Training Center tour for the full Olympic City experience.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Will I definitely see Olympic athletes training?</h4>
                            <p>Not necessarily. Athletes train on varying schedules, and some areas are off-limits during active training. You might see athletes, but it's not guaranteed. The facilities themselves are always interesting.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is the tour appropriate for kids?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, especially kids interested in sports. The tour is engaging for ages 6 and up. Younger children may lose interest during the walking tour. Strollers are accommodated.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How is this different from the Olympic Museum?</h4>
                            <p>The Training Center shows working facilities where athletes actually train. The Olympic & Paralympic Museum (separate location) is a full museum with exhibits, interactive experiences, and historical artifacts. Both are worth visiting if time allows.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I use the facilities myself?</h4>
                            <p>No. The Training Center is reserved for Olympic and Paralympic athletes. Visitors can only observe, not participate.</p>
