                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Elevation:</strong> 14,115 feet. <strong>Ways up:</strong> Cog Railway, Pikes Peak Highway, Barr Trail. <strong>Best for:</strong> Cog Railway for ease, driving for flexibility, hiking for challenge. <strong>Season:</strong> Year-round (weather permitting).</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Pikes Peak is America's Mountain—the most visited fourteener in North America and the inspiration for "America the Beautiful." Katherine Lee Bates wrote the song after her 1893 visit to the summit. At 14,115 feet, it offers views stretching across the plains to Kansas and deep into the Rocky Mountains.</p>

                    <p>Unlike most Colorado fourteeners, you don't have to hike Pikes Peak. The Cog Railway and Pikes Peak Highway provide access for everyone. But if you want the challenge, Barr Trail offers one of the most iconic summit hikes in the state.</p>

                    <h2 id="cog-railway">Broadmoor Manitou and Pikes Peak Cog Railway</h2>

                    <p>The Cog Railway is the easiest and most scenic way to reach the summit. The new trains (opened 2021) feature floor-to-ceiling windows and comfortable seating for the 9-mile journey.</p>

                    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> About 3 hours round-trip, including 40 minutes at the summit.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Adults $58-68, children $38-48 depending on season. Reservations required and often sell out weeks in advance.</p>

                    <p><strong>Departure:</strong> Trains leave from the depot in Manitou Springs at 515 Ruxton Avenue. The historic depot area has shops and restaurants.</p>

                    <p><strong>The experience:</strong> Narrated ride through mountain scenery, crossing trestles and climbing through different ecosystems. Watch for marmots and pikas near the summit.</p>

                    <h2 id="highway">Pikes Peak Highway</h2>

                    <p>The 19-mile Pikes Peak Highway climbs from 7,400 to 14,115 feet. It's fully paved and offers pullouts with stunning views along the way.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $15 per adult, $5 for children 6-15, free under 6. Cash or card accepted at the toll gate.</p>

                    <p><strong>Hours:</strong> Generally 7:30am to 5pm (last entry 3pm), but varies by season and weather. The road closes during storms and winter conditions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Drive time:</strong> About 2 hours round-trip, plus time at the summit. Don't rush—the views are worth stopping for.</p>

                    <p><strong>Vehicle requirements:</strong> Any passenger vehicle can make the drive. Keep it in low gear on the descent to save your brakes. RVs and trailers have restrictions.</p>

                    <h2 id="barr-trail">Barr Trail</h2>

                    <p>For hikers seeking a serious challenge, Barr Trail climbs 13 miles and 7,400 feet from Manitou Springs to the summit. Most people spread it over two days, camping at Barr Camp.</p>

                    <p><strong>Day hiking:</strong> Possible for very fit, acclimatized hikers. Start before dawn and expect 10-14 hours round-trip. Most people turn back before the summit.</p>

                    <p><strong>Barr Camp:</strong> A backcountry shelter at 10,200 feet, roughly halfway up. Reservations required for bunks or camping. They serve meals and have supplies.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Incline connection:</strong> Barr Trail is the descent route for the <a href="/manitou-springs/incline/">Manitou Incline</a>. You can combine them by climbing the Incline and continuing to the summit via Barr Trail.</p>

                    <p><strong>Conditions:</strong> Trail is well-maintained but demanding. Snow can linger into June above treeline. Afternoon thunderstorms are common—be off the summit by noon in summer.</p>

                    <h2 id="summit">At the Summit</h2>

                    <p>The new Summit Visitor Center (opened 2021) replaced the old summit house. It features a cafe, gift shop, and viewing areas protected from the wind.</p>

                    <p><strong>Famous donuts:</strong> The high-altitude donuts have been a Pikes Peak tradition since 1916. The low air pressure makes them extra fluffy. Worth trying.</p>

                    <p><strong>Altitude effects:</strong> At 14,115 feet, oxygen levels are 60% of sea level. Move slowly, stay hydrated, and descend if you feel seriously ill.</p>

                    <p><strong>Weather:</strong> Temperatures at the summit average 20-30 degrees colder than Manitou Springs. Bring layers even in summer. Wind is constant.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Book the Cog Railway early.</strong> Summer weekends sell out 4-6 weeks in advance. Book as soon as you confirm your travel dates.</p>

                    <p><strong>Start early for driving.</strong> Afternoon clouds often obscure summit views. Morning offers the clearest skies.</p>

                    <p><strong>Check road conditions.</strong> The highway closes for weather, construction, and special events. Check the official website before driving.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pump your brakes.</strong> On the descent, downshift and use engine braking. The road includes brake-check stations—use them. Overheated brakes cause accidents every year.</p>

                    <p><strong>Watch for wildlife.</strong> Marmots, pikas, and bighorn sheep live above treeline. They're accustomed to humans but keep your distance.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Which is better: Cog Railway or driving?</h4>
                            <p>The Cog Railway is more scenic and relaxing—you can enjoy the views without watching the road. Driving offers flexibility and lets you stop whenever you want. Both reach the same summit.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I hike up and take the train down?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, but you'll need to coordinate. Purchase a one-way ticket and confirm your expected arrival time. The Cog Railway can accommodate hikers with advance notice.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is Pikes Peak safe in winter?</h4>
                            <p>The Cog Railway runs year-round, weather permitting. The highway closes in winter. Barr Trail becomes a serious mountaineering objective requiring winter gear and experience.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How long should I plan for the summit?</h4>
                            <p>The Cog Railway allows 40 minutes. Drivers can stay as long as they want, but 30-60 minutes is typical. Altitude limits most people's energy for extended exploration.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Will I get altitude sickness?</h4>
                            <p>Many visitors feel some effects: shortness of breath, mild headache, fatigue. Serious altitude sickness is less common on short visits. Move slowly, stay hydrated, and descend if symptoms worsen.</p>
