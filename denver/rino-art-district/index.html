                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> River North, between downtown and I-70. <strong>Known for:</strong> Street art murals, breweries, galleries, and industrial-chic restaurants. Best explored on foot or by bike.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>RiNo (River North) was a forgotten industrial neighborhood just a decade ago. Old warehouses, railroad tracks, and not much else. Now it's the most dynamic, creative district in Denver - covered in massive street murals, packed with breweries, and home to some of the city's best restaurants.</p>

                    <p>The transformation happened when artists priced out of other neighborhoods moved into the cheap warehouse spaces. Galleries followed. Then breweries. Then restaurants. Now everyone wants a piece of RiNo, and the neighborhood changes almost monthly as new spots open.</p>

                    <h2 id="street-art">Street Art and Murals</h2>

                    <p>RiNo has more murals per square block than anywhere else in Colorado. Every alley, building side, and garage door seems to be painted by someone. The quality ranges from world-class artists to local newcomers, but the overall effect is stunning.</p>

                    <p>The best concentration is along Larimer Street between 25th and 38th. Just walk and look - you'll find new pieces around every corner. Crush Walls is the annual mural festival that brings in international artists and adds dozens of new works each September.</p>

                    <p><strong>Don't miss:</strong> The alley between Larimer and Walnut around 35th Street is particularly loaded with murals. The works change regularly as new artists paint over old ones, so what you see this month might be different next year.</p>

                    <h2 id="breweries">Breweries and Bars</h2>

                    <p>RiNo might have the highest concentration of craft breweries in Denver, which is saying something for a city obsessed with beer.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ratio Beerworks</strong> anchors the scene with excellent beers and a huge patio that's always packed on nice days. Their Dear You French Saison is a local favorite.</p>

                    <p><strong>Our Mutual Friend</strong> focuses on sours and wild ales in a cozy taproom. It's the spot for beer nerds who want something more adventurous than IPAs.</p>

                    <p><strong>Epic Brewing</strong> brings Utah's biggest craft brewery to Denver with bold, high-ABV beers and a spacious warehouse taproom.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Source</strong> isn't a brewery but houses Crooked Stave in an artisan market hall worth visiting for food and drinks.</p>

                    <p>For cocktails, <strong>Death & Co</strong> brought their legendary New York cocktail bar to RiNo. It's dark, stylish, and the drinks are impeccable. <strong>Bar Fausto</strong> offers a more casual neighborhood vibe with excellent drinks.</p>

                    <h2 id="food">Where to Eat</h2>

                    <p><strong>Safta</strong> serves modern Israeli food that's become one of Denver's most talked-about restaurants. The hummus is life-changing. The shakshuka is perfect. Make a reservation.</p>

                    <p><strong>Work & Class</strong> does Southern and Latin American comfort food in a lively, no-pretense space. The fried chicken and biscuits are outstanding, and the cocktails are strong.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cart-Driver</strong> makes Roman-style pizzas in a converted shipping container with a wood-fired oven. Simple, delicious, and there's usually a wait.</p>

                    <p><strong>Denver Central Market</strong> is a food hall packed with excellent vendors - tacos, ramen, pizza, oysters, coffee, and more. Great for groups who can't agree on one thing. <a href="/denver/central-market/">Full guide here</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Super Mega Bien</strong> brings tropical Latin flavors to a colorful, energetic space. Creative cocktails, vegetable-forward dishes, and a party atmosphere.</p>

                    <h2 id="galleries">Galleries and Studios</h2>

                    <p>RiNo has over 50 galleries, studios, and creative spaces. First Friday Art Walks bring thousands of people to explore openings, meet artists, and wander between venues with drinks in hand.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ironton Distillery</strong> combines a working distillery with an art gallery showcasing local and national artists. Sip whiskey while browsing paintings.</p>

                    <p><strong>PATTERN</strong> focuses on contemporary art and design in a beautiful converted warehouse. The shows are consistently excellent and thought-provoking.</p>

                    <p><strong>Leon Gallery</strong> represents emerging and established artists with a strong focus on works that address social and cultural issues.</p>

                    <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There</h2>

                    <p>RiNo is about a mile north of <a href="/denver/union-station/">Union Station</a>. You can walk it in 20 minutes, grab a scooter or bike, or take an <a href="/denver/uber-vs-lyft/">Uber/Lyft</a>. Parking is street-only and can be tough on busy nights.</p>

                    <p>The neighborhood is spread out, so comfortable walking shoes help. A good route: start at The Source on Brighton, walk down Larimer for murals and breweries, end at Denver Central Market.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Tips for Visiting</h2>

                    <p><strong>First Fridays:</strong> The monthly art walk (first Friday of each month) is the best time to experience RiNo's creative energy. Galleries open late, drinks flow, and the streets are alive.</p>

                    <p><strong>Weekend afternoons:</strong> Perfect for brewery hopping and mural hunting. The patios fill up by 3pm on nice days.</p>

                    <p><strong>Dinner reservations:</strong> Book ahead for popular spots like Safta. Walk-ins work at more casual places.</p>

                    <p><strong>Combine with other areas:</strong> RiNo connects easily to <a href="/denver/highlands/">LoHi</a> across the river and <a href="/denver/lodo/">LoDo</a> to the south.</p>
