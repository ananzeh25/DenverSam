<p><strong>Best coffee shops for remote work in Denver?</strong> Improper City (RiNo) is the top pick—outlets at every seat, fast WiFi, open until 10pm. Metropolis Coffee (Baker) has two floors with tons of power. The Bardo stays open until 11pm for night owls. Thump Coffee (Cap Hill) is quietest for focus work. Best times: 10am-noon and 2-4pm weekdays.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="improper-city">Improper City — Best Overall</h2>

<p>3201 Walnut St, RiNo. Open 7am-10pm daily. Improper City isn't just a coffee shop—it's casual coworking that serves great coffee. Every seat has outlet access, WiFi handles video calls without issues, and they serve beer after 3pm. The front room has more chatter, back room stays quiet for calls and focused work.</p>

<p>High-tops, lounge chairs, and big tables for different work styles. Staff know long stays are part of the deal. This is where Denver's freelancers gather. Best for all-day work sessions and coffee-to-beer transitions.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="metropolis">Metropolis Coffee — Best for Long Days</h2>

<p>300 E 6th Ave, Baker. Open 6:30am-6pm daily. Two floors with outlets everywhere. Main level has coffee shop bustle—register noise, espresso sounds, people talking. Upstairs is library-quiet, great for calls and deep focus. Natural light fills both floors, breakfast burritos are solid.</p>

<p>Parking is the main issue—lot behind fills fast, street spots vanish during busy hours. Get there early or budget extra time. Best for full work days when you need options between social buzz and quiet focus.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="the-bardo">The Bardo — Best Late Hours</h2>

<p>238 S Broadway. Open 6am-11pm daily. Most Denver coffee shops close by 6-7pm. The Bardo stays open until 11pm—essential for night owls and deadline crunches. The long bar has outlets under its full length, grab a bar seat and you're set for hours.</p>

<p>WiFi stays fast even when busy—they invested in real internet. Booths and tables offer other seating options. Best for evening work, late deadlines, and anyone whose productivity kicks in after dark.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="thump-coffee">Thump Coffee — Best for Focus</h2>

<p>1201 E 13th Ave, Capitol Hill. Open 7am-6pm daily. Thump draws people who take both coffee and work seriously. The vibe is quiet and focused—no loud phone calls or group hangouts. Mostly writers, designers, and coders doing heads-down work.</p>

<p>Fewer outlets than ideal, but they're at the best tables. Arrive early to claim a powered spot. Thump roasts their own beans, so the coffee is excellent. Capitol Hill parking is rough—bike or walk if possible. Best for deep focus, writing, and coding.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="more-options">More Solid Options</h2>

<p><strong>Novo Coffee</strong> (1600 Glenarm Pl, Downtown): Serious roasters with good work setup. Higher prices ($5-7) filter for focused crowd. <strong>Hooked on Colfax</strong> (3111 E Colfax Ave): The basement is the secret—quieter, outlets everywhere, room to spread out. Staff expect laptop campers. <strong>Aviano Coffee</strong> (244 Detroit St, Cherry Creek): Upscale setting with low noise, perfect for client video calls.</p>

<p><strong>Stella's Coffee Haus</strong> (1476 S Pearl St): No-frills, just tables and outlets and people working. Daily routine spot. <strong>Middle State Coffee</strong> (3100 Meade St, Highlands): Big windows, natural light, great vibes for creative work. <strong>Queen City Collective</strong> (73 W 7th Ave): Coffee until 3pm, brewery after—good for coffee-to-beer days.</p>

<h2 id="avoid">Shops That Don't Work</h2>

<p>Some Denver spots serve great coffee but fail as workspaces. <strong>Crema:</strong> Amazing coffee, almost no outlets, tiny space. <strong>Huckleberry:</strong> Great beans, too loud, limited power. <strong>Blue Sparrow:</strong> Excellent pour-over, seating built for quick visits. <strong>Little Owl:</strong> Cute but only two outlets total.</p>

<p>Most brewery coffee spots are made for hanging out—outlets cut on purpose. Good coffee shops, just not work coffee shops. Know the difference before you commit to a workday there.</p>

<h2 id="backup-options">Backup Options</h2>

<p><strong>Denver Public Library (Central):</strong> Free, outlets everywhere, 5th floor has quiet study spots. Hours 10am-8pm Mon-Tue, 10am-6pm Wed-Sat. <strong>Whole Foods upstairs:</strong> Most Denver locations have upper seating that works as free coworking. <strong>Hotel lobbies:</strong> Crawford at Union Station and Oxford Hotel have lobbies for working—look confident, buy a drink.</p>

<p>For dedicated coworking, Industry and Catalyst offer day passes. But coffee shops give you most of what you need for $10-15/day in drinks. Build a rotation of 3-4 spots for backup.</p>

<h2 id="best-times">Best Times to Work</h2>

<p>Sweet spots: 10am-noon (morning rush ends, workers settle in) and 2-4pm (light crowds, calm vibe). Avoid 8-10am morning rush and noon-1pm lunch rush at food spots. Weekdays beat weekends—Saturday and Sunday bring brunchers and families.</p>

<p>Etiquette: Buy something every 2 hours, don't take the best table, leave during rush if you can, tip well. You're using their space as an office—that tip on your coffee matters. These shops survive on sales, not seat rentals.</p>
