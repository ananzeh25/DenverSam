                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> East of downtown, centered around Colfax Avenue and Broadway. <strong>Known for:</strong> Dive bars, LGBTQ+ nightlife, live music, vintage shops, and counterculture vibes. Denver's most walkable neighborhood with the most character per block.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Capitol Hill is where Denver gets weird, in the best possible way. This dense, walkable neighborhood just east of downtown has been the city's creative and countercultural heart for decades. You'll find historic mansions next to dive bars, vintage shops next to acclaimed restaurants, and a mix of people you won't encounter anywhere else in Colorado.</p>

                    <p>The neighborhood takes its name from the Colorado State Capitol building that anchors its western edge, but the vibe couldn't be further from stuffy government buildings. Colfax Avenue - once called "the longest, wickedest street in America" - runs through the middle, and while it's cleaned up some, it still has an edge that other Denver neighborhoods have polished away.</p>

                    <h2 id="bars">Dive Bars and Nightlife</h2>

                    <p>Capitol Hill is Denver's bar neighborhood. Not the craft cocktail kind (though those exist too) but the cheap beer, sticky floor, jukebox playing kind. The concentration of watering holes per block is unmatched, and bar hopping here is a proper adventure.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Thin Man</strong> is a basement bar that's been pouring drinks since 1969. It's dark, it's cheap, and the regulars are characters. This is where you go when you want a real Denver dive experience, not a curated one.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wax Trax Records</strong> isn't a bar, but the legendary record store is a Capitol Hill institution. After browsing the vinyl, head next door to any number of spots for cheap drinks. <strong>Sancho's Broken Arrow</strong> nearby serves cheap well drinks to a crowd that skews young and scruffy.</p>

                    <p><strong>Charlie's</strong> is the anchor of Denver's LGBTQ+ nightlife scene, a country-western gay bar with line dancing and a welcoming vibe that draws everyone from regulars to bachelorette parties. <strong>X Bar</strong> and <strong>Tracks</strong> offer different flavors of queer nightlife, from leather bar to dance club.</p>

                    <h2 id="music">Live Music</h2>

                    <p>Capitol Hill is Denver's live music headquarters. The neighborhood has venues ranging from intimate clubs to mid-sized theaters, and on any given night you'll find local bands, touring acts, and everything in between.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Ogden Theatre</strong> hosts mid-sized national acts in a beautiful 1919 venue. The sight lines are good, the sound is excellent, and the history adds something special to every show. Right next door, <strong>The Bluebird Theater</strong> does the same thing in a slightly smaller, more intimate setting.</p>

                    <p><strong>Lion's Lair</strong> is a tiny dive bar with a small stage that's hosted everyone from local punks to surprise performances by touring musicians. It's grimy, it's loud, and it's exactly what rock and roll should be.</p>

                    <p><strong>Hi-Dive</strong> books local and touring indie acts in a casual bar setting. The patio is great for summer shows, and the vibe is unpretentious. It's the kind of venue where you discover your new favorite band.</p>

                    <h2 id="food">Where to Eat</h2>

                    <p>Capitol Hill's food scene matches its eclectic personality. You'll find everything from late-night pizza joints to acclaimed restaurants, often on the same block.</p>

                    <p><strong>Steuben's</strong> does upscale American comfort food - think fried chicken, mac and cheese, and meatloaf elevated to restaurant quality. The space is lively, the portions are generous, and it's become a neighborhood institution since opening in 2006.</p>

                    <p><strong>City O' City</strong> proves that vegetarian food can be genuinely exciting. The menu runs from breakfast through late-night, with creative dishes that even meat-eaters love. The attached coffee shop, <strong>Watercourse</strong>, offers more vegan options in a casual setting.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pete's Kitchen</strong> is a 24-hour Greek diner that's been feeding Denver since 1962. It's not fancy, but when you need 3am breakfast after bar hopping, Pete's delivers. The green chili smothered burritos are famous.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ace Eat Serve</strong> combines creative Asian street food with ping pong. Yes, really. The bao buns are excellent, the dumplings are shareable, and you can play table tennis between courses. It's exactly the kind of weird combo that works in Capitol Hill.</p>

                    <h2 id="shopping">Vintage and Thrift</h2>

                    <p>If you like digging through racks and shelves for unique finds, Capitol Hill is your neighborhood. The concentration of vintage shops, thrift stores, and quirky retailers rivals any city.</p>

                    <p><strong>Buffalo Exchange</strong> and <strong>Goodwill</strong> anchored the Broadway stretch, but the real gems are the independent shops. <strong>Boss Vintage</strong> curates high-end vintage clothing with an eye for quality. <strong>Decade</strong> focuses on '60s through '90s pieces with reasonable prices.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wax Trax Records</strong> has been selling vinyl since 1975, surviving the digital revolution through sheer coolness. The selection is massive, the staff is knowledgeable, and flipping through crates here feels like a pilgrimage.</p>

                    <h2 id="daytime">During the Day</h2>

                    <p>Capitol Hill isn't just a nightlife destination. The neighborhood has plenty to do when the sun is up, from people-watching on Colfax to exploring the quieter residential streets lined with historic mansions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cheesman Park</strong> provides green space on the neighborhood's eastern edge, with views of the mountains and the downtown skyline. The adjacent <strong>Denver Botanic Gardens</strong> offers cultivated beauty year-round, from spring flowers to summer concerts to holiday lights.</p>

                    <p>The coffee shops do brisk business with the laptop crowd. <strong>Thump Coffee</strong>, <strong>Pablo's Coffee</strong>, and <strong>Crema</strong> all offer good caffeine and workable wifi. Weekend brunch lines form outside popular spots like Steuben's and City O' City.</p>
