                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Length:</strong> 40 miles from Confluence Park downtown to Franktown. <strong>Surface:</strong> Paved and well-maintained. <strong>Best for:</strong> Biking, running, walking. Free to use, open dawn to dusk. Connects to the Platte River Trail for even more miles.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Cherry Creek Trail is Denver's spine of outdoor recreation. This 40-mile paved path follows Cherry Creek from its confluence with the South Platte River downtown all the way to the town of Franktown in Douglas County. Along the way, it passes through urban neighborhoods, suburban parks, and quiet stretches where you'll forget you're in a major city.</p>

                    <p>For visitors, the trail offers something unusual: a way to experience Denver without getting in a car. You can bike from downtown to <a href="/denver/cherry-creek/">Cherry Creek</a> shopping, run through quiet neighborhoods, or just take a long walk along the water. The path is wide, well-maintained, and popular with everyone from serious cyclists to families with strollers.</p>

                    <h2 id="access-points">Key Access Points</h2>

                    <p><strong>Confluence Park</strong> is where Cherry Creek meets the South Platte River, right in the heart of downtown. This is the most urban section, with the REI flagship store nearby and the Platte River Trail branching off. It's a logical starting point if you're coming from <a href="/denver/lodo/">LoDo</a> or <a href="/denver/union-station/">Union Station</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Speer Boulevard</strong> runs parallel to the trail through central Denver. Multiple access points along Speer let you hop on and off easily. The section between downtown and Cherry Creek North is popular with commuters and recreational users alike.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cherry Creek Shopping Center</strong> provides access near the upscale shopping district. Park at the mall, hit the trail, and reward yourself with lunch after your workout. The path continues southeast from here through increasingly suburban territory.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cherry Creek State Park</strong> is the major destination southeast of the city. The 4,200-acre park has a lake, beaches, and additional trails. You can bike the 40 miles from downtown or drive to the park and use it as a base for shorter rides.</p>

                    <h2 id="biking">Biking the Trail</h2>

                    <p>The Cherry Creek Trail is one of the best urban cycling routes in America. The surface is smooth asphalt, the grade is gentle, and the path is wide enough for passing. Serious road cyclists use it for training rides, while casual bikers enjoy the car-free environment.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bike rentals:</strong> Denver B-cycle stations are scattered throughout the city, including near trail access points. For longer rides, consider renting from a shop like Turin Bicycles or using one of the electric bike share options.</p>

                    <p><strong>Distance options:</strong> Downtown to Cherry Creek North is about 5 miles each way - a comfortable hour ride with stops. The full 40 miles to Franktown is a serious outing, best done as an out-and-back or with a pickup arranged at the far end.</p>

                    <h2 id="running">Running the Trail</h2>

                    <p>Runners love the Cherry Creek Trail for the same reasons cyclists do - smooth surface, no cars, and a long uninterrupted stretch. The downtown sections can get crowded, but the further southeast you go, the quieter it gets.</p>

                    <p><strong>Popular loops:</strong> The 10-mile round trip from Confluence Park to Cherry Creek and back is a Denver running classic. Mile markers help you track distance, and the few road crossings have signals or underpasses.</p>

                    <p>Early mornings and weekday afternoons are the least crowded. Weekend mornings see heavy traffic from both runners and cyclists, so be prepared to share the path.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Trail Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Stay right, pass left.</strong> The trail has enough traffic that etiquette matters. Keep to the right side, announce when passing, and be aware of faster cyclists coming up behind you.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bring water.</strong> The trail has some water fountains, but they're not frequent. At Denver's altitude and in summer heat, hydration matters more than you might expect.</p>

                    <p><strong>Watch for flood conditions.</strong> Cherry Creek is a creek, and it floods occasionally. The trail can be closed or underwater after heavy rains. Check conditions before planning a long ride.</p>

                    <p><strong>Connect to the Platte River Trail.</strong> At Confluence Park, the Cherry Creek Trail meets the South Platte River Trail, which runs north and south through the metro area. Together they form a network of over 100 miles of paved paths.</p>
