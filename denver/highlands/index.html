                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Northwest of downtown, across the South Platte River from LoDo. <strong>Known for:</strong> Trendy restaurants, boutique shopping on 32nd Avenue, rooftop bars, and Victorian homes with mountain views. The neighborhood Denverites love to frequent.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Highlands is where Denver locals actually hang out. While tourists pack into LoDo, the people who live here head across the river to this cluster of neighborhoods known for independent restaurants, local boutiques, and a walkable vibe that feels more like a small town than a major city.</p>

                    <p>Technically, "the Highlands" refers to several neighborhoods - Highland proper, LoHi (Lower Highlands), West Highland, and Sunnyside. LoHi gets the most attention for its restaurant scene and skyline views, but the whole area rewards exploration. You'll find Victorian homes on tree-lined streets, hip coffee shops on every corner, and some of the best food in Denver hiding in unassuming storefronts.</p>

                    <h2 id="restaurants">Where to Eat</h2>

                    <p><strong>Linger</strong> occupies a former mortuary - yes, really - and serves globally inspired small plates from a rooftop with downtown views. The building's history adds quirky charm (the old neon sign still says "mortuary"), but the food is the real draw. Creative dishes from around the world, shareable portions, and cocktails that match the adventurous menu.</p>

                    <p><strong>Root Down</strong> comes from the same team as Linger, serving farm-to-table American food in a converted gas station. The vegetable dishes are as satisfying as the meat options, and the brunch is legendary. It's been a neighborhood favorite for years and shows no signs of slowing down.</p>

                    <p><strong>LoHi Steak Bar</strong> does exactly what the name suggests - excellent steaks in a stylish but approachable setting. The cuts are high quality, the sides are elevated beyond the usual steakhouse fare, and the bar serves serious cocktails. Perfect for date night without the stuffiness of downtown steakhouses.</p>

                    <p><strong>Little Man Ice Cream</strong> is impossible to miss - it's housed in a 28-foot-tall cream can. The ice cream is made from scratch with local dairy, and the flavors range from classic to creative. Lines snake around the block on summer evenings, but the wait is worth it. Try the salted Oreo.</p>

                    <h2 id="lohi-strip">The LoHi Restaurant Strip</h2>

                    <p>Platte Street and the blocks around it have become restaurant row for Denver. This is where new concepts open and established chefs expand. Walking the strip, you'll pass taco spots, sushi bars, wine rooms, and everything in between.</p>

                    <p><strong>El Five</strong> serves Mediterranean tapas with perhaps the best rooftop view in Denver. The skyline spreads out before you while you share plates of lamb meatballs and Spanish tortilla. Reservations are essential, especially for the patio.</p>

                    <p><strong>Williams & Graham</strong> hides behind a bookcase in what looks like a regular shop. Give the hostess a name, and you'll be led through a hidden door into one of America's best cocktail bars. The drinks are impeccable, the atmosphere is 1920s speakeasy, and the whole experience feels like discovering a secret.</p>

                    <p><strong>Avanti Food & Beverage</strong> takes the food hall concept and does it with style. A collective of restaurants in shipping containers serves everything from tacos to ramen to wood-fired pizza. The rooftop has city views, and the vibe is casual enough for any occasion.</p>

                    <h2 id="32nd-avenue">32nd Avenue</h2>

                    <p>If LoHi is the flashy restaurant district, 32nd Avenue is the neighborhood's actual main street. This strip through Highland proper has local boutiques, coffee shops, and restaurants that cater to the people who live here, not just weekend visitors.</p>

                    <p><strong>Highland Tap and Burger</strong> makes one of Denver's best burgers in a casual, friendly space. The beer selection is solid, the patio is popular, and the vibe is unpretentious. It's the kind of neighborhood spot every city needs.</p>

                    <p><strong>Sushi Sasa</strong> serves the best sushi in Denver, full stop. It's an omakase-focused experience where Chef Wayne puts together courses based on what's fresh and in season. The fish is flown in daily, and the skill behind the counter is evident in every bite.</p>

                    <p>Shopping along 32nd includes indie bookstores, home goods shops, and clothing boutiques that stock brands you won't find at the mall. It's a great street for wandering on a weekend afternoon.</p>

                    <h2 id="coffee-drinks">Coffee and Drinks</h2>

                    <p>The Highlands takes its coffee seriously. <strong>Novo Coffee</strong> has a beautiful space that feels like a design magazine spread, with excellent single-origin options and skilled baristas. <strong>Thump Coffee</strong> offers a cozier vibe with outdoor seating and free wifi for the laptop crowd.</p>

                    <p>For afternoon drinks, <strong>Forest Room 5</strong> brings the outdoors inside with living walls and craft cocktails. <strong>Ale House at Amato's</strong> is a proper neighborhood bar with local beers and regulars who actually know each other. The contrast captures the Highlands perfectly - trendy spots and neighborhood institutions coexisting.</p>

                    <h2 id="getting-around">Getting There</h2>

                    <p>The Highlands is about a 15-minute walk from <a href="/denver/union-station/">Union Station</a>, across the Millennium Bridge. You can also take an <a href="/denver/uber-vs-lyft/">Uber or Lyft</a> - the neighborhoods are close to downtown but just far enough that a car helps if you're coming from further out.</p>

                    <p>Street parking is usually available, though LoHi's restaurant strip gets tough on weekend evenings. The neighborhoods are very walkable once you arrive, so park once and explore on foot. Scooters and bikes are popular for crossing between the Highlands, <a href="/denver/rino-art-district/">RiNo</a>, and downtown.</p>
