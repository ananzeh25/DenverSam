                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> 100 W 14th Ave Pkwy in the Golden Triangle. <strong>Hours:</strong> 10am-5pm (10pm Fridays). <strong>Cost:</strong> $15 adults, free for kids under 18. <strong>Highlights:</strong> Western American art, Indigenous art, architecture by Daniel Libeskind.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Denver Art Museum is the kind of place that surprises people. They expect a regional museum with modest ambitions and find instead one of the largest art institutions between Chicago and the West Coast. The building itself - a jagged, titanium-clad structure designed by Daniel Libeskind - makes a statement before you even get inside.</p>

                    <p>The permanent collection spans 70,000 works across cultures and centuries, with particular strength in American West and Indigenous American art. You won't find the encyclopedic holdings of New York's Met, but what's here is thoughtfully curated and genuinely impressive. Plan for at least two to three hours to see the highlights.</p>

                    <h2 id="collections">The Collections</h2>

                    <p>The <strong>American Indian Art</strong> collection is the museum's crown jewel - one of the most comprehensive in the world. It spans 2,000 years of creativity from tribes across North America, treating these works as the fine art they are rather than ethnographic curiosities. The pottery, textiles, beadwork, and contemporary pieces deserve serious attention.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>Western American Art</strong> galleries tell the story of the American West through art, from Frederic Remington bronzes to contemporary interpretations. It's not just cowboys and landscapes - the collection grapples with the complexity of Western history and mythology.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>Architecture, Design & Graphics</strong> department covers furniture, industrial design, and the built environment. It's the kind of collection that makes you see everyday objects differently. The textile and fashion holdings are also stronger than you might expect.</p>

                    <p>European and American art from the classical periods is well-represented, with works from the Renaissance through Modernism. The Impressionist gallery has some lovely pieces, and contemporary art gets serious attention in rotating exhibitions.</p>

                    <h2 id="building">The Building</h2>

                    <p>The Hamilton Building, designed by Daniel Libeskind and opened in 2006, is controversial and unforgettable. Sharp angles jut into the sky like crystalline rock formations, clad in titanium panels that shift color with the light. Inside, the architecture is equally dramatic - tilted walls, unexpected sightlines, and spaces that challenge your sense of orientation.</p>

                    <p>Some find it exhilarating; others find it distracting from the art. Either way, it's worth seeing. The older North Building, renovated in 2021, offers a calmer counterpoint with generous galleries and natural light. Together, they offer two very different museum experiences.</p>

                    <h2 id="visiting">Tips for Visiting</h2>

                    <p><strong>Start with what interests you.</strong> The museum is large enough to induce fatigue if you try to see everything. Pick two or three departments and give them proper attention rather than rushing through the whole building.</p>

                    <p><strong>Free days:</strong> The first Saturday of each month is free for Colorado residents. It's crowded but worth knowing about. Kids under 18 are always free, making this an excellent family destination.</p>

                    <p><strong>Friday nights:</strong> The museum stays open until 10pm on Fridays with special programming, DJs, and a bar. It's a more social, lively way to experience the galleries. Called "Untitled," these events draw a younger crowd.</p>

                    <p><strong>The cafe:</strong> Palettes restaurant offers better-than-expected museum dining with views of the atrium. It's a reasonable option for lunch if you're spending the day.</p>

                    <h2 id="nearby">Nearby Attractions</h2>

                    <p>The DAM sits in the Golden Triangle Creative District, Denver's museum neighborhood. The Clyfford Still Museum next door houses the largest collection of work from the Abstract Expressionist painter. The History Colorado Center is a block away. Together, they make for a full day of cultural exploration.</p>

                    <p>Civic Center Park spreads out in front of the museum, with the Colorado State Capitol visible at the far end. It's a pleasant walk to downtown or <a href="/denver/capitol-hill/">Capitol Hill</a> from here.</p>
