                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Between Union Station and Coors Field, bounded by 14th to 20th Streets. <strong>Known for:</strong> Historic brick buildings, rooftop bars, sports crowds, and Denver's best nightlife. The heart of downtown Denver.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>LoDo is where Denver comes to play. This historic warehouse district turned trendy neighborhood sits between <a href="/denver/union-station/">Union Station</a> and Coors Field, which means it's packed with people heading to baseball games, catching trains, or just looking for a good time. The brick buildings that once housed factories now hold some of the city's best restaurants and bars.</p>

                    <p>The transformation started in the 1990s when Coors Field opened and developers saw potential in the abandoned warehouses. Now LoDo is Denver's premier entertainment district, and on any given weekend night, the sidewalks are full of people moving between bars, restaurants, and clubs. It's lively, it's loud, and it's the closest thing Denver has to a true urban playground.</p>

                    <h2 id="restaurants">Where to Eat</h2>

                    <p><strong>Guard and Grace</strong> is the power-dinner steakhouse that serious meat lovers need to experience. The dry-aged steaks are exceptional, the wine list is extensive, and the atmosphere says "special occasion" without being stuffy. It's not cheap, but for a celebratory dinner, it delivers.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rioja</strong> has been a Denver institution for years, serving Mediterranean-inspired dishes that change with the seasons. Chef Jennifer Jasinski won a James Beard Award here, and the food lives up to the hype. The artisan cheese selection is particularly impressive.</p>

                    <p><strong>Euclid Hall</strong> (if you can still find it) pioneered the gastropub scene in LoDo with its creative bar food and impressive beer selection. The neighborhood has several spots now carrying that torch, serving elevated comfort food alongside craft cocktails.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wynkoop Brewing Company</strong> claims to be Colorado's first brewpub, opened in 1988 by future governor John Hickenlooper. The beer is solid, the food is better than average pub fare, and the upstairs has pool tables and shuffleboard if you want to make a night of it.</p>

                    <h2 id="nightlife">Bars and Nightlife</h2>

                    <p>LoDo is Denver's nightlife headquarters. On Friday and Saturday nights, the streets around Market and Blake fill with crowds moving between venues. The vibe ranges from dive bars to upscale lounges, with something for everyone who wants to stay out late.</p>

                    <p><strong>Dairy Block</strong> is an alley-turned-destination with a collection of bars, restaurants, and the Maven Hotel. The Poka Lola Social Club serves cocktails in a stylish setting, while Kachina Cantina offers rooftop margaritas with downtown views. The whole block feels like a curated experience rather than a random collection of venues.</p>

                    <p><strong>Viewhouse</strong> brings the rooftop bar experience with multiple levels, outdoor games, and views of the city. It's a scene, especially during baseball season when Rockies fans pack the patios. Come for the energy, not the intimate conversation.</p>

                    <p><strong>1UP</strong> combines arcade games with drinking, filling a warehouse space with classic cabinets, pinball machines, and a full bar. It's nostalgic, it's fun, and it's surprisingly popular with everyone from first dates to bachelor parties. Two locations now serve the Denver metro.</p>

                    <h2 id="sports">Game Day in LoDo</h2>

                    <p>Coors Field sits at the edge of LoDo, and baseball season transforms the neighborhood. The rooftop bars fill with purple-clad fans, the restaurants set up outdoor TVs, and the streets buzz with pre-game energy. Even if you don't have tickets, LoDo is the place to be during a Rockies game.</p>

                    <p>The bars along Blake Street become de facto fan zones, with many offering game-day specials and big screens. Blake Street Tavern is a classic sports bar that's been serving fans since the stadium opened. Jackson's is another institution where you'll find cheap beers and crowded high-tops.</p>

                    <p>Beyond baseball, LoDo fills up before Broncos games (the stadium is a short ride away) and any major sporting event. The concentration of TVs per square foot rivals any sports district in America.</p>

                    <h2 id="daytime">During the Day</h2>

                    <p>LoDo isn't just a nightlife destination. During the day, the neighborhood works as a business district and tourist hub. The walk from <a href="/denver/union-station/">Union Station</a> through LoDo to <a href="/denver/larimer-square/">Larimer Square</a> is one of Denver's classic urban strolls.</p>

                    <p>Shopping options include everything from national chains to local boutiques. The Tattered Cover bookstore has a LoDo location if you need reading material. Several coffee shops serve the remote-work crowd, with Huckleberry Roasters being a local favorite.</p>

                    <p>The 16th Street Mall runs along the edge of LoDo, offering free shuttle rides and pedestrian-friendly access to shops and restaurants. It's touristy, but it's also practical for getting around without a car.</p>

                    <h2 id="getting-around">Getting There and Parking</h2>

                    <p>If you're coming from the airport, the A-Line train drops you right at Union Station in the heart of LoDo. From there, everything is walkable. <a href="/denver/uber-vs-lyft/">Rideshare</a> works well for getting to and from other neighborhoods, especially late at night.</p>

                    <p>Parking in LoDo is expensive and limited, especially on game days and weekend nights. Street parking meters run until late, and the garages charge premium rates. If you're planning to drink, skip the car entirely and use rideshare or the light rail.</p>

                    <p>The free MallRide shuttle runs the length of 16th Street Mall, connecting LoDo to the rest of downtown. It's not fast, but it's free and convenient for short hops.</p>
