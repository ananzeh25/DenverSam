<p><strong>What should I do on my first trip to Denver?</strong> Must-see: Red Rocks Amphitheatre (sunrise, free), RiNo Art District (murals + breweries), Union Station (food + architecture), Washington Park (locals' favorite). Skip 16th Street Mall. Drink double your normal water—altitude is real at 5,280 feet. Best neighborhoods to stay: LoDo for convenience, Capitol Hill for value.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="altitude">Altitude & Weather Reality</h2>

<p>Denver sits at 5,280 feet—higher than any major US city. You'll feel winded on stairs, get drunk faster, and sleep poorly the first night. Drink twice your normal water intake, skip alcohol day one, and take it easy. Most people adjust by day two. Headache, nausea, or extreme fatigue means rest and hydrate more.</p>

<p>Weather changes fast. Sunny mornings can turn to afternoon thunderstorms or even snow. Always carry layers. Spring is unpredictable (70°F or snow). Summer brings hot days with afternoon storms. Fall is perfect (60-70°F, sunny). Winter is cold but sunny—snow melts quickly downtown.</p>

<h2 id="red-rocks">Red Rocks Amphitheatre</h2>

<p>No other city has anything like Red Rocks—a natural amphitheater carved into 300-million-year-old red sandstone. Even without a concert, the geology and mountain views are stunning. Free to visit, 17 miles from downtown (25-30 min drive). Trading Post Trail offers free parking plus a 0.7-mile hike to the venue.</p>

<p>Visit at sunrise (6-8am) for empty stairs and perfect photos. Sunset crowds pack the place. Lots of steep stairs—skip if you have mobility issues. Climb the venue stairs for a workout with a view. The museum inside covers music history and geology.</p>

<h2 id="rino">RiNo Art District</h2>

<p>This former industrial area has more character than all of downtown combined. Street art murals cover every surface, breweries anchor every block, and Denver Central Market serves as the food hall anchor. The alley between 25th and 27th on Larimer has the best murals. Plan 2-3 hours minimum.</p>

<p>Free parking on side streets off Brighton Blvd before 10am. Denver Central Market (11am-9pm) has 11 vendors—perfect for groups who can't agree on food. Great Divide, Ratio, and Our Mutual Friend are the standout breweries. First Friday art walks (monthly, free) bring galleries and street performances.</p>

<h2 id="union-station">Union Station</h2>

<p>More than a train station—it's a food hall, bar scene, and architectural landmark in one. The Great Hall has leather couches, shuffleboard, and craft cocktails. Terminal Bar is casual, Cooper Lounge is upscale. Free concerts on the outdoor plaza Thursday evenings in summer.</p>

<p>The A-Line train connects to the airport ($10.50, 37 min). Validate parking at any restaurant for 2 hours free. Morning coffee at Pigtrain, evening drinks at the hotel bars. Walk to Larimer Square (5 blocks) for boutique shopping and the city's best restaurants.</p>

<h2 id="washington-park">Washington Park</h2>

<p>City Park has the zoo, but Wash Park has Denver's soul. This is where locals actually spend weekends—biking the 2.6-mile lake loop, playing volleyball, picnicking on the grass. Rent bikes ($10/hour) and join them. Mount Evans views from the north side on clear days.</p>

<p>Saturday mornings (May-October) bring the farmers market. Bathrooms near the boathouse and rec center. The surrounding neighborhood has excellent brunch spots and coffee shops. Less touristy than downtown, more representative of actual Denver life.</p>

<h2 id="skip">What to Skip</h2>

<p>16th Street Mall is a tourist corridor with chain stores and persistent panhandlers. Locals avoid it entirely. Use it as a free transit route (hop-on/hop-off buses) but don't plan to spend time there. Larimer Square, 5 blocks away, has actual character with local boutiques and restaurants.</p>

<p>Casa Bonita reopened with huge hype but requires reservations months in advance. The cliff divers are fun, the vibe is campy, but the food still isn't worth the effort unless you're a South Park superfan. Downtown Aquarium is overpriced—Denver Botanic Gardens offers a better experience for similar cost.</p>

<h2 id="food">What to Eat</h2>

<p>Green chile goes on everything in Denver—breakfast burritos, burgers, eggs. Sam's No. 3 does it right at multiple locations. Rocky Mountain oysters (if you're brave) at The Buckhorn Exchange. Bison burgers at My Brother's Bar, where Kerouac used to drink. Huckleberry Roasters for craft coffee.</p>

<p>Food halls solve the "what should we eat" problem: Denver Central Market (RiNo, best variety), Avanti F&B (LoHi, rooftop views), Milk Market (downtown, 16 restaurants). The brewery-to-restaurant ratio in Denver is absurd—you're never more than a few blocks from good craft beer.</p>

<h2 id="neighborhoods">Where to Stay</h2>

<p>LoDo (Lower Downtown) puts you walking distance from Union Station, Larimer Square, and Coors Field. Best for first-timers who want convenience. Capitol Hill is cheaper, still central, and has a more local vibe with dive bars and music venues. RiNo is artsy with great food but needs more Uber rides.</p>

<p>Avoid airport area hotels unless you have an early flight—it's 25 miles from downtown with nothing around. Cherry Creek is upscale shopping if that's your scene. Budget $100-150/day for hostels and food trucks, $200-300/day for mid-range hotels and restaurants, $400+/day for luxury.</p>

<h2 id="getting-around">Getting Around</h2>

<p>Downtown is walkable but covers 2+ miles. Budget for Ubers between neighborhoods ($8-15 per ride). The A-Line train connects the airport to Union Station ($10.50, 37 min). Free MallRide buses run the length of 16th Street. Scooters are everywhere downtown.</p>

<p>Rent a car for Red Rocks and mountain day trips—you won't need one otherwise. Peak times matter: Red Rocks at sunrise not sunset, breweries at 3pm not 7pm, RiNo before 10am for parking. Denver sleeps early by big-city standards—don't expect a 2am party scene.</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<div class="faq-item">
<h4>Is the altitude really a problem in Denver?</h4>

</div>
