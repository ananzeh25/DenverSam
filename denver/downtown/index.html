                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> The core of downtown Denver, centered around 16th Street Mall from Civic Center to Union Station. <strong>Known for:</strong> The State Capitol (stand at exactly one mile high), 16th Street Mall, Civic Center Park, and the Denver Performing Arts Complex. The city's transit hub and connector to better neighborhoods.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Downtown has a few worthwhile stops and serves as the hub connecting better neighborhoods like <a href="/denver/lodo/">LoDo</a> and <a href="/denver/larimer-square/">Larimer Square</a>.</p>

    <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #6b7280; margin-top: 8px; text-align: center;">Downtown Denver sits at exactly 5,280 feet - one mile above sea level</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>The State Capitol Building (Free)</h2>

<p>The 13th step of the State Capitol is exactly one mile above sea level - 5,280 feet. They've marked it with a brass medallion, and yes, everyone takes a photo there. The building itself is worth seeing for the Colorado rose onyx interior, which you literally cannot find anywhere else on Earth because the quarry is depleted.</p>

<p>Free tours run Monday through Friday and take you inside the gold dome for city views. The dome is covered in 200 ounces of real gold leaf - they've had to re-gild it three times since 1908. If you're not into guided tours, you can wander the first floor on your own and still see the impressive rotunda.</p>

<h2>16th Street Mall</h2>

<p>The 16th Street Mall is Denver's pedestrian spine - a mile-long stretch of shops, restaurants, and street performers running from Civic Center to <a href="/denver/union-station/">Union Station</a>. The free MallRide shuttle runs every few minutes if you don't want to walk the whole thing. It's practical, but don't expect to be wowed.</p>

<p>Here's the honest truth: the Mall has struggled in recent years. Some storefronts are empty, the homeless population is noticeable, and the chain restaurants outnumber interesting local spots. It's still useful for getting around, and the architecture is pleasant enough, but this isn't the highlight of your Denver trip. Walk through it to get somewhere better.</p>

<h2>Civic Center Park</h2>

<p>This is Denver's grand civic space, sitting between the State Capitol and the City and County Building. The Greek amphitheater hosts summer concerts, and the views looking east toward the Capitol are classic Denver postcard material. It's where political rallies happen, where the city celebrates, and where you'll find food trucks on summer Fridays.</p>

<p>The park is better during events than on random weekdays. Civic Center Eats brings food trucks on Tuesdays and Thursdays in summer. The annual Cinco de Mayo festival is one of the largest in the country. If nothing's happening, it's a pleasant 10-minute walk-through rather than a destination.</p>

<h2>Denver Performing Arts Complex</h2>

<p>The second-largest performing arts complex in the country (after Lincoln Center) sits in the heart of downtown. Ten venues host Broadway tours, the Colorado Symphony, Colorado Ballet, and Opera Colorado. The complex is connected by an 80-foot glass roof that makes even a walk between buildings feel special.</p>

<p>If you want to see a show, the touring Broadway productions are usually excellent. The Buell Theatre hosts the big musicals, while the Ellie Caulkins Opera House is an architectural gem worth seeing even if you're not into opera. Check the calendar before your trip - getting tickets to a good show elevates the whole downtown experience.</p>

<h2>Where to Eat Downtown</h2>

<p>Skip the chains on 16th Street Mall and walk a few blocks to find the real food. <a href="/denver/larimer-square/">Larimer Square</a> is just one block over and has Rioja, TAG, and other restaurants that are actually worth your money.</p>

<p><strong>The Delectable Egg</strong> does breakfast right if you're downtown in the morning. <strong>Snooze</strong> has creative pancake flights and usually a wait, but it's worth it. For quick lunch, <strong>Illegal Pete's</strong> makes solid burritos at reasonable prices.</p>

<p>If you want something nicer, <strong>Guard and Grace</strong> in the nearby <a href="/denver/lodo/">LoDo</a> neighborhood is one of Denver's best steakhouses. <strong>The Capital Grille</strong> downtown is reliable for business dinners. For a special occasion, walk to Larimer Square for more interesting options.</p>

<h2>Getting Around Downtown</h2>

<p>The <strong>free MallRide</strong> shuttle runs the length of 16th Street Mall every few minutes. It's efficient and saves your legs. The light rail connects downtown to the rest of the city, with the D, F, and H lines running through the middle of downtown along the mall.</p>

<p>From the airport, the <strong>A-Line train</strong> drops you at Union Station for $10.50. From there, you can walk or take the MallRide to most downtown hotels. <a href="/denver/uber-vs-lyft/">Rideshare</a> works fine but gets expensive during rush hour.</p>

<p>Parking is pricey everywhere downtown. Street meters max out at 2 hours, and garages charge $20-40 for the day. If you're staying downtown, leave the car at the hotel and walk or take transit.</p>

<h2>Is Downtown Denver Worth Visiting?</h2>

<p>Downtown is practical rather than exciting. You'll probably pass through it on your way to better neighborhoods like <a href="/denver/lodo/">LoDo</a>, <a href="/denver/rino-art-district/">RiNo</a>, or the <a href="/denver/highlands/">Highlands</a>. The Capitol is genuinely interesting, and seeing a show at the Performing Arts Complex is worthwhile, but don't spend your whole Denver trip walking up and down 16th Street.</p>

<p>The best approach: hit the Capitol in the morning, grab lunch in Larimer Square, and then head to a neighborhood with more personality. Downtown works as a connector between Denver's interesting areas rather than a destination in itself.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is downtown Denver safe?</h4>
                            <p>During the day, downtown is generally safe but has a visible homeless population, especially around Civic Center Park and parts of 16th Street Mall. Stick to busier areas at night. LoDo and Larimer Square are safer evening options.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What's the best way to get from the airport to downtown Denver?</h4>
                            <p>The A-Line train runs from DEN to Union Station in 37 minutes for $10.50. It's cheaper and often faster than rideshare, especially during rush hour. Trains run every 15 minutes.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is 16th Street Mall worth visiting?</h4>
                            <p>It's worth walking through once, especially if you take the free MallRide shuttle. But don't plan to spend hours there - the restaurants are mostly chains, and nearby LoDo and Larimer Square offer better options.</p>

                            <p>Union Station has the Crawford Hotel for a unique experience. The Oxford Hotel in LoDo is historic and well-located.
