                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> 1701 Wynkoop St, Denver. <strong>Hours:</strong> Open 24/7 (individual businesses vary). <strong>Parking:</strong> Underground garage available. Home to restaurants, bars, shops, and the A-Line train to DIA.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Union Station is the heart of Denver. This 1914 Beaux-Arts train station sat abandoned for years before a massive renovation transformed it into one of the most beautiful public spaces in the city. Now it's part transportation hub, part food hall, part living room for Denver.</p>

                    <p>Walk through the massive wooden doors and you'll find yourself in the Great Hall - a soaring space with original chandeliers, leather sofas, shuffleboard tables, and some of Denver's best restaurants and bars lining the edges. It's the kind of place where you can spend an entire evening just wandering, drinking, and people-watching.</p>

                    <h2 id="restaurants">Where to Eat</h2>

                    <p><strong>Mercantile Dining & Provision</strong> is the flagship restaurant from chef Alex Seidel. It's upscale farm-to-table Colorado cuisine with a menu that changes seasonally. The attached market sells artisan cheeses, charcuterie, and specialty groceries. Not cheap, but worth it for a special occasion.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stoic & Genuine</strong> serves some of the best seafood in a landlocked state. Fresh oysters, creative fish preparations, and a raw bar that rivals coastal cities. The atmosphere is casual-upscale, and the bar is a great spot for solo dining.</p>

                    <p><strong>Snooze</strong> handles breakfast and brunch with creative pancake flights and eggs benedict variations. Expect a wait on weekends - it's wildly popular. The pineapple upside-down pancakes are famous for a reason.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pigtrain Coffee</strong> is the go-to for caffeine. Local roaster with excellent espresso drinks and pastries. Perfect for grabbing something quick before catching a train.</p>

                    <p><strong>Milkbox Ice Creamery</strong> serves small-batch ice cream with creative flavors. The salted butterscotch is a standout. Great for a dessert walk around the station.</p>

                    <h2 id="bars">Where to Drink</h2>

                    <p><strong>Terminal Bar</strong> anchors one end of the Great Hall with an impressive cocktail program and craft beer selection. The bartenders know their stuff. Grab a seat at the long bar and watch the station buzz around you.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cooper Lounge</strong> is the hidden gem upstairs. It's a members-first bar, but anyone can visit on a first-come basis if there's room. The speakeasy vibe, craft cocktails, and views down into the Great Hall make it worth seeking out.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ultreia</strong> combines a restaurant with one of Denver's best wine bars. Spanish-influenced small plates pair perfectly with their extensive sherry and wine selection. The bar area is ideal for a pre-dinner drink.</p>

                    <h2 id="transportation">Getting Around</h2>

                    <p>Union Station is Denver's main transit hub. The A-Line train runs directly to Denver International Airport in about 37 minutes for $10.50 - way cheaper and often faster than rideshare during rush hour. Trains leave every 15 minutes.</p>

                    <p>The RTD light rail and bus lines connect here too, making it easy to get around the city without a car. The free 16th Street Mall shuttle runs right outside, connecting you to the heart of downtown.</p>

                    <p>Amtrak's California Zephyr stops here on its Chicago to San Francisco route. It's one of the most scenic train rides in America, crossing the Rockies through tunnels and canyons that you can't see from the highway.</p>

                    <h2 id="staying">The Crawford Hotel</h2>

                    <p>If you want to stay inside Union Station, The Crawford Hotel occupies the upper floors with rooms that blend historic charm with modern luxury. Pullman rooms are built in converted train cars. Loft suites have exposed brick and mountain views.</p>

                    <p>Staying here puts you steps from everything - restaurants, bars, and trains. It's not budget-friendly, but for a special Denver experience, it's hard to beat waking up in this beautiful building.</p>

                    <h2 id="events">Events and Activities</h2>

                    <p>The Great Hall hosts rotating events throughout the year. Summer brings outdoor movies and concerts on the plaza. Winter transforms the space with holiday decorations and a pop-up ice rink nearby. The shuffleboard tables and giant chess boards are always available.</p>

                    <p>The surrounding LoDo neighborhood is Denver's nightlife center. Within walking distance you'll find dozens of restaurants, rooftop bars, and <a href="/denver/craft-breweries/">craft breweries</a>. Coors Field (home of the Rockies) is just a few blocks away.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Tips for Visiting</h2>

                    <p><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Late afternoon into evening when the light through the windows is beautiful and the bars start buzzing. Weekday lunches are calmer if you want a quieter experience.</p>

                    <p><strong>Parking:</strong> The underground garage is convenient but pricey. Street parking is tough in LoDo. Consider taking the light rail or an <a href="/denver/uber-vs-lyft/">Uber/Lyft</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Free wifi:</strong> Available throughout the station. Plenty of people work from the leather couches in the Great Hall.</p>

                    <p><strong>Combine with LoDo:</strong> Plan to explore <a href="/denver/lodo/">Lower Downtown</a> and <a href="/denver/larimer-square/">Larimer Square</a> while you're in the area. Everything is walkable.</p>
