                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> 2300 Steele St in City Park. <strong>Hours:</strong> 10am-5pm daily (seasonal variations). <strong>Cost:</strong> $20-25 adults depending on season. <strong>Size:</strong> 80 acres with 3,000+ animals. Plan for 3-4 hours minimum.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Denver Zoo is the most visited attraction in Colorado, drawing over 2 million people annually. That popularity is earned - this 80-acre facility in City Park houses more than 3,000 animals across thoughtfully designed habitats that have evolved far beyond cages and concrete. It's a proper day trip, and one of the best family outings in Denver.</p>

                    <p>Founded in 1896 with an orphaned black bear cub named Billy Bryan, the zoo has grown into one of the top-ranked facilities in the country. Recent renovations have transformed older exhibits into immersive experiences, and the commitment to conservation runs through everything from animal care to sustainability initiatives.</p>

                    <h2 id="exhibits">Must-See Exhibits</h2>

                    <p><strong>Toyota Elephant Passage</strong> is the zoo's flagship exhibit and one of the largest elephant habitats in North America. Asian elephants roam 10 acres designed to mimic their natural environment, with pools for swimming, varied terrain for exercise, and viewing areas that put you surprisingly close to these massive animals.</p>

                    <p><strong>Primate Panorama</strong> houses gorillas, orangutans, and other apes in habitats that encourage natural behavior. The gorilla viewing area is particularly impressive, with large windows that let you observe the family dynamics up close. Arriving at feeding times increases your chances of activity.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tropical Discovery</strong> brings jungle ecosystems indoors - a relief on cold Denver winter days. The humid, plant-filled building houses tropical fish, reptiles, and birds, with winding paths that make you feel like you've left Colorado entirely.</p>

                    <p><strong>Predator Ridge</strong> recreates an African savanna with lions, hyenas, and wild dogs visible from multiple vantage points. The design allows animals to move between areas, keeping the experience dynamic rather than static.</p>

                    <h2 id="planning">Planning Your Visit</h2>

                    <p>The zoo is large enough that you can't see everything in a hurried visit. Arrive when gates open to see animals at their most active and beat the midday crowds. Morning is generally better than afternoon for animal viewing, as many species rest during the warmest hours.</p>

                    <p>Check the daily schedule for feeding times and keeper talks. These programs offer the best chances to see animals engaged and active, plus you'll learn from the people who know these animals best. The giraffe feeding experience is worth the extra few dollars.</p>

                    <p>Comfortable shoes are essential - you'll walk several miles exploring the grounds. The paths are paved and stroller-friendly. Wagons are available for rent and are popular with families of small children.</p>

                    <h2 id="seasons">Seasonal Considerations</h2>

                    <p><strong>Summer</strong> is peak season with the longest hours and biggest crowds. Animals may rest during the hottest midday hours. Early morning and late afternoon are the best times for viewing and photos.</p>

                    <p><strong>Winter</strong> offers shorter hours but thinner crowds. Many animals are more active in cooler weather, and the indoor exhibits provide warm refuge. Zoo Lights during the holiday season transforms the grounds into a spectacular light display.</p>

                    <p><strong>Spring and fall</strong> hit the sweet spot - moderate crowds, pleasant weather, and active animals. These shoulder seasons are ideal for photography and relaxed exploring.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Tips for Visiting</h2>

                    <p><strong>Buy tickets online.</strong> Prices are often lower, and you skip the ticket window line. The zoo uses timed entry during busy periods, so booking ahead guarantees your slot.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bring your own food.</strong> Outside food is allowed, and picnic areas are available. The on-site dining options are typical zoo fare - fine but not memorable, and priced accordingly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Don't miss the bears.</strong> The grizzly bear and polar bear exhibits are easy to overlook but feature some of the zoo's most charismatic animals. The underwater viewing area for polar bears is particularly impressive.</p>

                    <p><strong>Check for special events.</strong> From summer concerts to seasonal festivals, the zoo hosts events throughout the year that add extra value to your visit.</p>

                    <h2 id="city-park">Combine with City Park</h2>

                    <p>The zoo sits within City Park, Denver's largest park and a destination in its own right. The Denver Museum of Nature & Science is across the park, making for an easy double-header if you have the energy. The park's lake, paths, and views of the downtown skyline and mountains reward a post-zoo stroll.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How much time do I need at Denver Zoo?</h4>
                            <p>Plan for 3-4 hours to see the highlights comfortably. Families with young children often spend a full day. Rushing through in less than 2 hours means missing most of what makes it special.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What age is Denver Zoo best for?</h4>
                            <p>All ages enjoy it, but kids 3-12 tend to get the most out of a visit. The exhibits are engaging for adults too, especially if you're interested in conservation and animal behavior.</p>
