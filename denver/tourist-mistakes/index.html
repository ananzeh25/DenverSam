<p><strong>What mistakes do tourists make in Denver?</strong> Underestimating altitude (drink double water, skip alcohol day one), packing wrong for weather (bring layers year-round), cramming too much into one day (max two activities), eating at tourist traps (skip 16th Street Mall), and expecting mountains IN Denver (they're 30+ minutes west). These mistakes ruin more trips than anything else.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="altitude">Underestimating Altitude</h2>

<p>Denver sits at 5,280 feet—20% less oxygen than sea level. Marathon runners get wrecked walking up stairs on day one. Your fitness level back home doesn't matter. First day strategy: do nothing strenuous, walk slowly, drink water constantly, save hiking for day three. One beer here hits like two at sea level.</p>

<p>Too many visitors get destroyed on night one and suffer the rest of their trip. Drink half your normal alcohol amount with water between every drink. Expect mild headaches and fatigue initially—that's normal. Most people adjust by day two if they take it easy day one.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="weather">Packing Wrong for Weather</h2>

<p>Denver weather has mood swings. Yesterday was 85 degrees? Today it's 45 and snowing. Temperature can drop 40 degrees between afternoon and evening. People pack for summer because it's July, then freeze at night. Layers aren't optional—bring a jacket even in July.</p>

<p>Summer afternoons bring thunderstorms between 2-4pm like clockwork. Visitors start mountain hikes at noon and get caught in dangerous lightning. Do outdoor activities before noon, save city activities for storm-prone afternoons. Check weather hourly, not daily.</p>

<h2 id="itinerary">Cramming Too Much In</h2>

<p>Visitors try to cram Red Rocks, hiking, brewery tours, museums, RiNo, and LoHi dinner into one day. Result: entire day in the car, exhausted, seeing nothing properly. Denver has tons to do, which makes people think they need to do everything immediately. That's a recipe for a miserable trip.</p>

<p>Maximum two major activities per day. One morning activity, one afternoon or evening activity. That's it. You'll actually enjoy things instead of rushing through them. Leave buffer time for discoveries. Quality beats quantity every time.</p>

<h2 id="geography">Expecting Mountains IN Denver</h2>

<p>Denver sits on the plains. Mountains are 30+ minutes west. People expect Aspen vibes and get confused seeing a regular city. You can see mountains FROM Denver on clear days—you're not IN them. Denver is a major urban center with mountain access, not a ski village with skyscrapers.</p>

<p>The distance confusion is worse for mountain towns. Aspen is four hours away. Vail is two hours. These aren't suburbs you "pop over to." Someone always wants to "quickly see" a mountain town and loses their entire day. Plan full-day trips or skip mountains entirely.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="food">Eating in Tourist Traps</h2>

<p>16th Street Mall restaurants, convention center chains, hotel restaurants—that's where tourists eat. You're missing Denver's actual food scene in the neighborhoods. RiNo, LoHi, South Broadway have the restaurants locals recommend. Skip tourist districts entirely.</p>

<p>Green chili is Denver's signature—it goes on breakfast burritos, burgers, fries. Visitors leave without trying it, like skipping pizza in New York. Order it on something at least once. Ask bartenders and servers for recommendations—they'll steer you right.</p>

<h2 id="logistics">Transportation and Costs</h2>

<p>Denver's public transit is limited—routes are sparse, schedules weird. Budget for Ubers or rent a car if you want efficiency. Popular spots at peak times equal disaster: Red Rocks at 10am Saturday means parking nightmares. Go early (6am is magical) or go late. Weekdays beat weekends.</p>

<p>Denver is expensive. $18 cocktails, $200 hotel rooms, $30 parking. Budget like San Francisco, not a mountain town. Happy hours help significantly. Dispensaries are often cash-only with expensive ATMs inside—bring cash ahead. The sun is stronger at altitude—SPF everything, even on cloudy days.</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<div class="faq-item">

</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h4>What should I pack for Denver weather?</h4>
<p>Layers year-round. Temperatures can drop 40 degrees between afternoon and evening. Bring a light jacket even in July. Check weather hourly since conditions change fast.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h4>Where should I stay in Denver?</h4>
<p>LoDo, RiNo, or Capitol Hill to stay central. Avoid Aurora or airport hotels—you'll waste your vacation in Ubers. Walking distance to activities saves money and time.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h4>Where do locals eat in Denver?</h4>
<p>Skip 16th Street Mall and downtown tourist traps. RiNo, LoHi, and South Broadway have actual good restaurants. Try green chili on something—it's Denver's signature dish.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h4>Do I need a car in Denver?</h4>
