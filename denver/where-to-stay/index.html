<h2 id="top-neighborhoods">Top 5 Neighborhoods for Visitors</h2>

<h3 id="lodo">1. LoDo/Union Station</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> First-time visitors<br>
<strong>Price:</strong> $200-400/night<br>
<strong>Walk Score:</strong> 95/100</p>

<p>LoDo means "Lower Downtown." It's Denver's most walkable area. Union Station sits at the center—a beautiful 1914 train station with bars, restaurants, and great people-watching.</p>

<p><strong>What's within walking distance:</strong> Coors Field (5 min), 16th Street Mall (10 min), Confluence Park (10 min), RiNo art district (15 min), Denver Art Museum (20 min).</p>

<p><strong>Where to stay:</strong> The Maven (modern hotel above a food hall, best value), The Crawford (inside Union Station, historic and pricey), The Oxford (Denver's oldest hotel from 1891, classic luxury).</p>

<p><strong>The catch:</strong> Weekend nights get loud. Bars close at 2 AM and crowds spill into the streets. Light sleepers should ask for rooms facing away from Larimer Street.</p>

<p><strong>Safety:</strong> LoDo is safe day and night. Stick to main streets after dark. High foot traffic and visible police.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="rino">2. RiNo (River North Art District)</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Food and nightlife<br>
<strong>Price:</strong> $180-350/night<br>
<strong>Walk Score:</strong> 85/100</p>

<p>RiNo stands for "River North Art District." It's Denver's coolest area right now. Old warehouses now hold breweries, restaurants, and 100+ street murals. The vibe is hip and artsy. Denver Central Market is here—a food hall with local vendors. First Fridays bring art walks with live music and open galleries.</p>

<p><strong>Where to stay:</strong> The Source Hotel (connected to a market hall, rooftop bar with mountain views), The Ramble (boutique hotel with a speakeasy, books up fast), Catbird Hotel (colorful design, good cocktails).</p>

<p><strong>The catch:</strong> RiNo is more spread out than LoDo. Walking between spots means 10-15 minute stretches through quiet areas. Hotel options are limited—book early.</p>

<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Main streets are fine at night. Avoid side streets and areas under highway bridges after dark.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="capitol-hill">3. Capitol Hill</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Budget travelers<br>
<strong>Price:</strong> $100-200/night<br>
<strong>Walk Score:</strong> 91/100</p>

<p>Capitol Hill is Denver's most eclectic area. It's LGBTQ+ friendly, full of dive bars, and half the price of LoDo. Colfax Avenue runs through the middle with vintage shops, cheap eats, and real city character. Downtown is a 20-minute walk. Cheesman Park offers green space for morning runs. This area has the most Airbnb options in Denver.</p>

<p><strong>Where to stay:</strong> The Art Hotel (best hotel option in the area), The Warwick (business-class hotel on the edge of the neighborhood), Airbnb (lots of budget apartments here).</p>

<p><strong>The catch:</strong> Capitol Hill feels grittier than LoDo. Colfax Avenue has some homeless camps and street drama. This is real city living, not a polished tourist zone.</p>

<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Daytime is fine everywhere. Nighttime varies by block. Main streets with bars feel safe. Quiet side streets can feel sketchy.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="highlands">4. Highlands/LoHi</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Local experience<br>
<strong>Price:</strong> $150-300/night<br>
<strong>Walk Score:</strong> 78/100</p>

<p>Highlands is where Denver locals hang out. The food scene rivals RiNo. The vibe is more neighborhood than tourist zone. LoHi (Lower Highlands) has the most restaurants. A 15-minute walk across the bridge gets you to LoDo. But that distance adds up over a weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Where to stay:</strong> The Lumber Baron Inn (Victorian B&B, unique but limited rooms), Airbnb (best option for this area, many quality rentals).</p>

<p><strong>The catch:</strong> Few hotels. You'll need a car or frequent Ubers to reach downtown sites. Best for repeat visitors who've already done the tourist stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Excellent. One of Denver's safest areas. Low crime, family feel, safe to walk at night.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="cherry-creek">5. Cherry Creek</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Families<br>
<strong>Price:</strong> $250-450/night<br>
<strong>Walk Score:</strong> 72/100</p>

<p>Cherry Creek is Denver's upscale shopping district. It's clean, safe, and feels suburban. High-end stores, nice restaurants, and Denver's lowest crime rates. Families with young kids often choose Cherry Creek for the safety and calm vibe. Cherry Creek Trail connects to downtown via 42 miles of paved path.</p>

<p><strong>Where to stay:</strong> The Halcyon (Cherry Creek's best hotel, modern with rooftop pool), JW Marriott (solid upscale chain option).</p>

<p><strong>The catch:</strong> Far from downtown. No nightlife. You'll Uber to anything fun. The area feels like wealthy suburbia, not urban Denver.</p>

<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Excellent. Denver's safest area. Low crime, well-lit streets, very family-friendly.</p>

<h2 id="skip">Neighborhoods to Skip</h2>

<h3 id="cbd">Downtown/CBD (Central Business District)</h3>
<p><strong>Why people book it:</strong> "Downtown" address, near the convention center.</p>
<p><strong>Why skip it:</strong> Office buildings empty at 5 PM. The 16th Street Mall has struggled—many stores sit vacant. The area feels dead at night.</p>
<p>The Brown Palace Hotel is the exception. It's a historic gem worth the stay. Other CBD hotels are generic business properties.</p>
<p><strong>Better choice:</strong> Walk 10 minutes north to LoDo.</p>

<h3 id="airport">Denver Airport Area</h3>
<p><strong>Why people book it:</strong> $89/night hotels seem like a great deal.</p>
<p><strong>Why skip it:</strong> The airport sits 25 miles from downtown in empty prairie. You'll spend $50-100 daily on Ubers. There's nothing within walking distance. No restaurants, no bars, nothing to do.</p>
<p>The A-Line train connects the airport to Union Station in 37 minutes for $10.50. Stay downtown and take the train.</p>
<p><strong>Only stay here if:</strong> You have a 5 AM flight and need to leave at 3 AM.</p>

<h3 id="dtc">Denver Tech Center</h3>
<p><strong>Why people book it:</strong> Business meetings in the area.</p>
<p><strong>Why skip it:</strong> It's not Denver—it's suburbs. Office parks, chain hotels, chain restaurants. 30+ minutes from actual city life.</p>
<p><strong>Only stay here if:</strong> Your work meetings are in DTC and you won't leave the area.</p>

<h2 id="bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Stay in LoDo/Union Station for your first Denver trip. Yes, it costs more. But you'll walk to everything instead of watching Denver pass by in Uber windows.</p>
<p>RiNo works if food and nightlife matter most. Capitol Hill saves money while keeping you central. Highlands suits repeat visitors wanting a local feel.</p>
<p>Skip the airport hotels, Tech Center, and generic CBD properties. The money you save gets eaten by transportation costs and wasted time. Pay for location. Stay where you can walk.</p>
