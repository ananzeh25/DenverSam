<p><strong>What's the best one-day Denver itinerary with kids?</strong> Start at Union Station: breakfast at Snooze (8:30am), Downtown Aquarium (9:30am, shark feeding at 10:30am), Confluence Park for free play (noon), Tattered Cover bookstore for quiet time (1:30pm), Children's Museum (2:30pm), dinner back at Union Station (5:30pm). Budget: $150-350 for family of four. No car needed.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="home-base">Union Station as Home Base</h2>

<p>Union Station works as your family command center—free WiFi, clean bathrooms with changing tables, indoor and outdoor seating, plus a dozen food options when someone has a meltdown. Park once ($8-20/day in nearby lots) or arrive by A-Line train from the airport ($10.50). Download ParkWhiz app to reserve parking for $8-12 instead of $20+ drive-up rates.</p>

<p>Everything on this itinerary is walking distance or a quick Uber from Union Station. The beauty of this home base: when plans fall apart (and they will), you're already surrounded by backup options. Bathrooms, snacks, seating, shade—all covered without hunting for parking again.</p>

<h2 id="morning">Morning: Breakfast and Aquarium</h2>

<p>Start at Snooze inside Union Station at 8:30am—no walking required. Their pancake flight ($14) lets picky eaters try three flavors. Kids eat free on Tuesdays. Order kids' meals first since they come out faster. Grab coffee from Pigtrain (20 feet away) while waiting for a table. Budget $45-60 for a family of four.</p>

<p>Downtown Aquarium is a 12-minute walk via 16th Street (flat, stroller-friendly). Basic admission runs $19.99 adults, $13.99 kids 3-11. Hit the shark tunnel at 10:30am for feeding time. Free stingray petting happens at 11am and 2pm. Skip the 4D theater unless you have kids under 6 who love bubbles. Buy tickets online for 10% off.</p>

<h2 id="midday">Midday: Free Play and Quiet Time</h2>

<p>Confluence Park is free, spacious, and has that Colorado outdoor magic parents are looking for. Kids can wade in shallow water and throw rocks—bring a towel. Ages 2-6 love watching kayakers, ages 7-12 love the climbing rocks. Parents love the shaded benches and the fact it's impossible to lose sight of kids. Grab lunch from Whole Foods (next to Union Station) beforehand.</p>

<p>Tattered Cover bookstore at 1:30pm is your secret weapon—a 45-minute reset button for overstimulated kids. Kids can actually touch and read books unlike museums. Free storytime happens Saturdays at 2pm. Coffee bar for desperate parents. Bathrooms in back left corner, no purchase required.</p>

<h2 id="afternoon">Afternoon: Children's Museum</h2>

<p>Children's Museum of Denver is a 7-minute Uber ($8-10) or catch Route 28 bus (free with kids under 5). Regular admission is $19.95 ages 2-59, under 2 free. After 4pm admission drops to $14.95 and still gives you 2.5 hours. First Tuesday monthly is $1 admission but expect crowds.</p>

<p>Must-hit exhibits: toddlers love the water play area (bring change of clothes), ages 4-7 love the real fire truck they can climb, ages 8+ enjoy the teaching kitchen with actual cooking. The three-story climbing structure works for all ages. There's a quiet room on the second floor if anyone needs a sensory break.</p>

<h2 id="evening">Evening: Dinner and Wrap-Up</h2>

<p>Head back to Union Station by 5:30pm for dinner. Terminal Bar has counter service (no wait), mac and cheese ($8), and outdoor seating by fountains. Mercantile Dining is quick-service where everyone can choose different foods. Stoic & Genuine works if kids can handle a sit-down meal—best kids' menu at $12-14. Summer bonus: let kids play in splash fountains outside while you finish your drink.</p>

<p>If kids still have energy at 7pm, walk 5 minutes to Larimer Square for ice cream at Gelato Boy ($5 cups). If everyone's done, the free MallRide shuttle gives kids a "train ride" back to your car. Union Station's Great Hall has live music Thursday through Saturday if you're staying downtown.</p>

<h2 id="tips">Planning Tips</h2>

<p>Total budget for family of four: $150-180 budget version (pack lunch, skip aquarium, free museum day), $280-350 standard version (all attractions, eat out twice), $400+ splurge version (add train rides, treats, souvenirs). Every location is stroller-accessible. Children's Museum has free stroller parking. Confluence Park paths are paved.</p>

<p>Weather backup: if it's too hot, spend more time at indoor venues and skip Confluence Park. Rain? Everything except the park works perfectly. Snow? Kids love the Union Station plaza in snow—bring mittens. Pack layers since Denver weather changes fast. Altitude makes kids hungrier and thirstier—bring snacks and refillable water bottles.</p>
