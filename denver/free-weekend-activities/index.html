<p><strong>What's free to do in Denver on weekends?</strong> City Park Jazz (summer Sundays 6-8pm), RiNo street art walk, Confluence Park for water watching, Colorado State Capitol tours, First Friday art walks in RiNo. The real hack: Denver Public Library offers free museum passes for any day—skip the crowded free days entirely.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="parks">Parks Worth Your Time</h2>

<p>City Park Jazz runs summer Sundays 6-8pm and brings out half of Denver—bring a blanket and picnic supplies. Cheesman Park has the best sunset views in the city, period. Washington Park's 2.5-mile loop attracts runners, skaters, and volleyball players. Sloan's Lake offers 2.96 miles of waterfront with mountains on one side and city skyline on the other.</p>

<p>Confluence Park is where the rivers meet downtown—people bring tubes and float in summer, or just walk along the water. The walk from Union Station to Confluence Park to REI to Commons Park to LoHi kills 2-3 hours without spending a dollar. This is what locals actually do when they want to get out without spending money.</p>

<h2 id="downtown">Downtown & Union Station</h2>

<p>Union Station people-watching is genuinely underrated—grab a bench in the Great Hall and watch the chaos. The outdoor plaza has summer concerts Thursday evenings. Wynkoop Plaza fountains entertain kids while adults relax on the steps. Larimer Square window shopping costs nothing and the string lights after dark make it worth the walk.</p>

<p>Colorado State Capitol offers free tours Monday-Friday with dome access—the views from up top are incredible, and you can stand on the mile-high step. Civic Center Park hosts food trucks, festivals, and random events throughout the year. Summer Wednesdays bring Civic Center EATS with enough food trucks to turn the park into an outdoor food court.</p>

<h2 id="art">Art & Culture</h2>

<p>RiNo street art changes constantly—start at Denver Central Market and wander the alleys between 25th-29th on Larimer for the best murals. First Friday art walks (monthly, 6-10pm) open galleries for free with occasional complimentary drinks. The murals alone justify multiple visits since new pieces appear regularly.</p>

<p>Denver Art Museum is free for anyone under 18, always. The Denver Central Library downtown is massive and worth exploring even without checking out books. Tattered Cover bookstores welcome browsers—stay as long as you want reading without pressure to buy. Burns Park Sculpture Garden on the west side stays quiet with weird sculptures and zero crowds.</p>

<h2 id="seasonal">Seasonal Events</h2>

<p>City Park Jazz transforms summer Sundays into outdoor concerts with thousands of people. Pride Festival takes over Civic Center Park in June with free admission. Oktoberfest on Larimer charges for beer but wandering and people-watching costs nothing. The Chalk Art Festival turns Larimer Square into a giant canvas with artists creating insane sidewalk pieces.</p>

<p>Cherry Creek Farmers Market runs Saturdays May-October with free samples if you time it right. South Pearl Street closes to traffic Sundays for vendors and live music. Denver Flea at National Western (first weekend monthly) offers vintage browsing without purchase pressure. Christmas lights around Union Station and downtown make December walks festive.</p>

<h2 id="hacks">Free Day Hacks</h2>

<p>Denver Public Library museum passes are the real secret—reserve online, pick up at any branch, get free entry on regular days instead of crowded free days. SCFD free days exist for every museum but attract massive crowds. The library pass hack lets you go on a quiet Wednesday instead. Sunday street parking downtown is free—game changer for planning your day.</p>

<p>Hot days: Confluence Park for water watching or any brewery patio where water is free. Cold days: Union Station wandering, Denver Central Library, Tattered Cover browsing. The honest truth about Denver: the best free activity is just existing outside on a nice day with a blanket in a park. Half the city does exactly this every weekend and nobody pretends otherwise.</p>
