                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Northwest Denver, centered on Tennyson Street between 38th and 46th Avenues. <strong>Known for:</strong> Independent shops, neighborhood restaurants, local breweries, and a community feel that's refreshingly un-touristy. This is where Denverites actually live.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Berkeley and the Tennyson Street corridor represent Denver at its most authentic. While tourists pack into RiNo and LoDo, the people who actually live here spend their weekends walking dogs, brunching at neighborhood spots, and shopping at stores owned by people who know their names. It's not flashy, but that's the point.</p>

                    <p>The neighborhood has the bones of old Denver - tree-lined streets, historic bungalows, and a main street that grew organically rather than being developed all at once. Tennyson Street runs through the heart of it, lined with restaurants, coffee shops, boutiques, and bars that cater to locals rather than visitors.</p>

                    <h2 id="tennyson">Tennyson Street</h2>

                    <p>Tennyson is the kind of main street every neighborhood wishes it had. About a mile of walkable shops and restaurants stretch between 38th and 46th Avenues, with the densest concentration of spots between 40th and 44th. You can park once and spend hours wandering.</p>

                    <p><strong>Hops & Pie</strong> combines excellent pizza with an impressive tap list of craft beers. The pies are creative without being gimmicky, and the beer selection leans heavily toward Colorado breweries. It's become a neighborhood institution.</p>

                    <p><strong>Parisi</strong> serves Italian food in a relaxed neighborhood setting. The pasta is made fresh, the portions are generous, and it feels like dinner at a friend's house - if your friend happened to be an excellent cook.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bao Brewhouse</strong> brings Asian street food and house-brewed beer to the strip. The bao buns are the star, but the whole menu rewards exploration. The brewery side produces interesting styles you won't find elsewhere.</p>

                    <h2 id="coffee-drinks">Coffee and Drinks</h2>

                    <p><strong>Corvus Coffee Roasters</strong> is one of Denver's best specialty coffee shops, roasting their own beans and taking the craft seriously without being pretentious about it. The space is comfortable for working or hanging out, and the baristas know their stuff.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tennyson's Tap</strong> is a proper neighborhood bar - no cocktail program, no small plates, just a good tap list and a room full of people who probably live within walking distance. It's the kind of place that's hard to find and easy to love.</p>

                    <p><strong>Call to Arms Brewing</strong> makes some of Denver's best beer in an unassuming taproom. The focus is on quality over flash, with a rotating selection that rewards repeat visits. It's a reminder that great breweries don't need to be huge or trendy.</p>

                    <h2 id="shopping">Local Shopping</h2>

                    <p>Tennyson's shops lean toward independent and local. You won't find chains here - instead, it's boutiques stocking local designers, home goods stores with curated selections, and specialty shops that reflect the neighborhood's personality.</p>

                    <p><strong>Berkeley Supply</strong> stocks outdoor gear and lifestyle products with a focus on quality and sustainability. Think carefully selected camping equipment, well-made bags, and the kind of stuff that lasts.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wordshop</strong> is a bookstore and letterpress studio that captures the creative spirit of the neighborhood. Browse the shelves, pick up a card, and remember that independent bookstores are worth supporting.</p>

                    <h2 id="berkeley-lake">Berkeley Lake Park</h2>

                    <p>Berkeley Lake Park provides the green space that makes this neighborhood so livable. The lake itself is modest, but the surrounding park has trails, playgrounds, and plenty of space for picnics and dog walking. On nice days, the whole neighborhood seems to gather here.</p>

                    <p>The path around the lake is about a mile, perfect for a morning run or evening stroll. You'll see kayakers and paddle boarders in summer, and the mountain views to the west are a reminder of why people move to Denver.</p>

                    <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There</h2>

                    <p>Berkeley is about 15 minutes from downtown by car, or you can take an <a href="/uber-vs-lyft-in-denver-comparing-prices-wait-times-and-features/">Uber or Lyft</a>. Street parking along Tennyson is usually available, though weekends can be tighter. Once you're there, everything is walkable.</p>

                    <p>The neighborhood isn't on the tourist radar, so don't expect much in the way of public transit. That's part of its charm - it's a place you have to seek out, not stumble upon.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is Berkeley worth visiting as a tourist?</h4>
                            <p>If you want to see how Denverites actually live, yes. If you're looking for famous attractions and Instagram spots, probably not. It's a neighborhood, not a destination - and that's what makes it great.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What's the best restaurant on Tennyson?</h4>
                            <p>Hops & Pie for pizza and beer, Parisi for Italian, Bao Brewhouse for something different. The quality is consistently high along the whole strip.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is Berkeley walkable?</h4>
                            <p>Very. Tennyson Street is a perfect walking corridor, and the surrounding residential streets are pleasant to explore. Berkeley Lake adds a nice green loop.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How is Berkeley different from Highlands?</h4>
                            <p>Similar neighborhood feel, but less polished and less expensive. Berkeley is where you go when Highlands feels too crowded or too trendy. It's the next neighborhood over with a slightly lower profile.</p>
