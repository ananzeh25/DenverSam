                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Teams:</strong> Broncos (NFL), Nuggets (NBA), Avalanche (NHL), Rockies (MLB), Rapids (MLS). Denver is one of only 13 U.S. cities with all five major sports leagues. The Nuggets won the 2023 NBA Championship.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Denver is a serious sports town. The city supports five major professional teams, and game days transform entire neighborhoods into seas of orange, purple, burgundy, and blue. The altitude gives home teams a genuine advantage - visiting players feel the thin air, and the fans are loud enough to make it matter.</p>

                    <p>Whether you're catching a Broncos game in the fall, watching the Nuggets defend their title, or enjoying a summer evening at Coors Field, Denver delivers authentic sports experiences. Here's everything you need to know about seeing professional sports in the Mile High City.</p>

                    <h2 id="broncos">Denver Broncos (NFL)</h2>

                    <p>The Broncos are Denver's obsession. Three Super Bowl championships and a passionate fanbase that sells out every game make Empower Field at Mile High one of the loudest stadiums in football. Orange Fridays are a real thing here - the whole city wears team colors before home games.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stadium:</strong> Empower Field at Mile High holds 76,125 fans and sits just west of downtown. The open-air design means you'll feel the weather, so dress in layers for late-season games. The mountain views from the upper deck are stunning when the sky is clear.</p>

                    <p><strong>Getting tickets:</strong> Games regularly sell out, so buy in advance. The secondary market (StubHub, SeatGeek) is your best bet for last-minute seats. Expect to pay premium prices for divisional rivalries and prime-time games.</p>

                    <p><strong>Game day:</strong> Tailgating is huge - the lots open early and the party starts hours before kickoff. If you're not tailgating, the bars in <a href="/denver/lodo/">LoDo</a> fill up with fans before and after games. Plan for traffic and consider light rail or rideshare.</p>

                    <h2 id="nuggets">Denver Nuggets (NBA)</h2>

                    <p>The 2023 NBA champions play at Ball Arena downtown, and the energy in that building during the playoff run was electric. Nikola Jokić has become the face of the franchise, and watching him orchestrate the offense in person is something special.</p>

                    <p><strong>Arena:</strong> Ball Arena (formerly Pepsi Center) seats about 19,500 for basketball. The sightlines are good from almost anywhere, and the atmosphere has only gotten better since the championship. It's also where the Avalanche play.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tickets:</strong> Easier to get than Broncos tickets, but marquee matchups sell out. Weeknight games against smaller-market teams are your best bet for affordable seats. The upper level offers good views for the price.</p>

                    <h2 id="avalanche">Colorado Avalanche (NHL)</h2>

                    <p>The Avs won the Stanley Cup in 2022, making Denver a two-time champion city in consecutive years. Hockey has deep roots here, and the fanbase is passionate. Games are fast, physical, and genuinely exciting even if you're new to the sport.</p>

                    <p><strong>Arena:</strong> Ball Arena, shared with the Nuggets. Hockey configuration seats about 18,000. If you've never seen NHL hockey live, the speed is remarkable - TV doesn't capture how fast these players move.</p>

                    <p><strong>Experience:</strong> The atmosphere is intense, especially during rivalry games against teams like Minnesota or Vegas. Playoff hockey at Ball Arena is some of the best sports viewing in Denver.</p>

                    <h2 id="rockies">Colorado Rockies (MLB)</h2>

                    <p>Coors Field might be the best place in America to watch a baseball game. The stadium sits in the heart of <a href="/denver/lodo/">LoDo</a>, surrounded by bars and restaurants. Mountain views peek over the outfield walls. The rooftop seating is uniquely Denver.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stadium:</strong> Coors Field opened in 1995 and still feels fresh. The Rooftop offers standing-room views with a party atmosphere. The Rockpile in center field sells $6 tickets on game day - one of the best deals in baseball.</p>

                    <p><strong>The altitude factor:</strong> At 5,280 feet, baseballs fly farther. Coors Field is a hitter's paradise, and high-scoring games are common. The humidor helps, but expect offense.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best experience:</strong> Summer evening games with the sun setting over the mountains are perfect. Friday night fireworks after the game draw big crowds. The surrounding neighborhood makes it easy to grab dinner before or drinks after.</p>

                    <h2 id="rapids">Colorado Rapids (MLS)</h2>

                    <p>The Rapids play at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, about 20 minutes northeast of downtown. Soccer has grown significantly in Denver, and the supporters' section brings genuine energy. It's a more affordable and family-friendly option than the big four sports.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stadium:</strong> Purpose-built for soccer with 18,000 seats and good sightlines. The location isn't as convenient as downtown venues, so plan your transportation.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Game Day Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Altitude affects you too.</strong> At 5,280 feet, you'll feel the effects of alcohol faster. Pace yourself, especially if you're visiting from sea level. Drink water between beers.</p>

                    <p><strong>Use transit when possible.</strong> Ball Arena and Coors Field are easily accessible by light rail. Empower Field has decent transit options too. Parking is expensive and traffic is frustrating - <a href="/denver/uber-vs-lyft/">rideshare</a> or rail makes the experience better.</p>

                    <p><strong>Dress for weather.</strong> Denver's climate can swing wildly. Even summer baseball games can cool off quickly after sunset. Fall football games range from pleasant to freezing. Check the forecast and layer up.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Which Denver team is the hardest to get tickets for?</h4>
                            <p>The Broncos, by far. Football has fewer home games, and the fanbase is enormous. Nuggets and Avs playoff games are also tough. Rockies are the easiest - 81 home games and a big stadium.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">

                            <p>Coors Field for atmosphere and accessibility - it's in the heart of downtown with great bars nearby. For pure fan energy, Broncos games are unmatched.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
