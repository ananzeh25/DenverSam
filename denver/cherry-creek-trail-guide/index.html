<p><strong>Where is Cherry Creek Trail?</strong> Cherry Creek Trail runs 22 miles from Confluence Park in downtown Denver to Cherry Creek Reservoir. It's a paved, car-free path perfect for biking, running, and walking. The most popular section starts at Confluence Park (15th & Platte St) and ends at Cherry Creek State Park. Free to use, open sunrise to sunset.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="overview">Trail Overview</h2>

<p>Cherry Creek Trail is Denver's best urban bike path, running 22 continuous miles from downtown to the reservoir. The paved trail follows Cherry Creek through neighborhoods, under highways, and past parks—all without crossing a single traffic light. Most of the path sits below street level, creating a quiet green corridor where you forget you're in a city.</p>

<p>The trail connects Confluence Park, where Cherry Creek meets the South Platte River, to Cherry Creek State Park and its reservoir beach. Along the way, you'll pass through wealthy neighborhoods near the Denver Country Club, the Cherry Creek Shopping District, and quieter suburban stretches before reaching the water. It's the best way to see Denver without a car.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="route">The Full Route Breakdown</h2>

<p>Starting at Confluence Park, the trail heads southeast past REI and under Speer Boulevard. Miles 2-4 pass through the Country Club neighborhood—massive homes, tree cover, and a feeling like you're biking through someone's private estate. By mile 4, you're at Cherry Creek Mall with options to stop for food or keep riding toward the quieter sections.</p>

<p>Miles 6-8 are where casual riders turn back, but this is where the trail gets good. Fewer people, more wildlife, actual nature. The final stretch opens up as Cherry Creek Dam comes into view, and suddenly you're at the reservoir beach—sand, water, kayak rentals, and mountain views. The return trip takes about 45 minutes by bike.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="best-time">Best Time to Ride</h2>

<p>Weekday mornings before 9am offer the best experience—empty trail, cool temperatures, and serious cyclists who know trail etiquette. Sunday mornings before 10am work well too, though expect more families. Avoid Saturday afternoons when the downtown section becomes a crowded mess of tourists, strollers, and people who don't understand which side to walk on.</p>

<p>Fall is the best season with perfect weather and stunning foliage along the creek. Summer works but gets hot and crowded. Spring brings high water and occasional muddy patches. Winter is surprisingly rideable most days—the trail stays clear, though watch for icy spots under bridges where sun doesn't reach.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="bike-rental">Bike Rental Options</h2>

<p>BCycle stations dot the downtown section of the trail, but they only work for the first few miles. For the full reservoir ride, rent from Campus Cycles near the University of Denver or SloHi Bike Co in RiNo. E-bikes are a game changer if you're doing the whole 22-mile round trip—the headwind coming back can be brutal, especially in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Skip the electric scooters. They're technically not allowed on the trail, and rangers will tell you to leave. If you're visiting without a bike, the BCycle day pass works fine for exploring the downtown-to-mall section, which is still worth doing even if you don't make it to the reservoir.</p>

<h2 id="trail-stops">Key Stops Along the Trail</h2>

<p>Confluence Park at mile 0 has water, restrooms, and usually food trucks nearby. Creekside Park at mile 2 offers a hidden rest stop with benches and shade. The Whole Foods at mile 4 (right off the trail near Cherry Creek Mall) is perfect for snacks and a real bathroom. Pulaski Park at mile 5.5 has a pond, turtles, and picnic tables—kids love it.</p>

<p>Garland Park at mile 8 is your last bathroom stop before the reservoir, with baseball fields and a playground. Cherry Creek State Park at mile 11 has the beach, marina, swimming, and kayak rentals. There's a park entrance fee ($11 per vehicle) if you're driving in, but bikes enter free through the trail.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="connecting-trails">Connecting Trails</h2>

<p>Cherry Creek Trail connects to several other Denver trails for longer rides. At Confluence Park, it meets the South Platte River Trail heading north to REI and south toward Englewood. Near the reservoir, the High Line Canal Trail branches off for a 30+ mile loop option through the southeast suburbs. Serious cyclists often combine these for 40-50 mile routes.</p>

<p>For a city loop, take Cherry Creek to the reservoir, then High Line Canal north, connecting back to the Platte River Trail and returning to Confluence. It's roughly 35 miles and shows you parts of Denver most residents never see. Bring snacks—the suburban sections have fewer stop options.</p>

<h2 id="tips">Practical Tips</h2>

<p>June and July are goose poop season—the path gets gross in some sections. Flash floods can close parts of the trail after heavy rain, especially the lower sections near Confluence. The afternoon wind blowing east makes the return trip harder than the outbound ride, so start early if you're doing the full distance. Mornings are calmer.</p>

<p>Under some bridges you'll see homeless camps. I've never had issues, and the city regularly clears the occupied areas. The trail runs below street level most of the way, which means no phone signal in some spots. Download offline maps if you're unfamiliar with the route. Water fountains exist but aren't everywhere—bring a bottle.</p>
