<p>Not every Denver museum deserves your $25. Some are incredible. Others? You're better off walking through RiNo for free.</p>

<p>Here's what's worth it, what's overpriced, and where to find great art without spending anything.</p>

<h2>If You Only Have Time for a Few Stops</h2>

<p><strong>RiNo Art District</strong> is free and honestly more interesting than most paid museums. Over 200 murals that change monthly.</p>

<p><strong>Denver Art Museum</strong> is worth $22 if you care about Native American art. Their collection is genuinely world-class.</p>

<p><strong>Meow Wolf</strong> costs $45 and will either blow your mind or completely confuse you. No in-between.</p>

<p><strong>Clyfford Still Museum</strong> has 95% of one artist's entire life work. You literally can't see this anywhere else.</p>

<h2>Denver Art Museum ($22)</h2>

<p>The building is honestly more impressive than some of the art inside. That wild Libeskind building looks like a spaceship crashed into downtown.</p>

<p>But the Native American collection on Level 3? One of the best in the country. 18,000+ pieces. Worth the admission alone.</p>

<p>Quick tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kids under 18 are free (huge family savings)</li>
<li>Your ticket includes same-day entry to Clyfford Still next door</li>
<li>Start on Level 3, work down - you'll dodge the crowds</li>
</ul>

<p>Skip if you only like classical European art. The collection there is limited.</p>

<h2>RiNo Art District (Free)</h2>

<p>This is my favorite cultural spot in Denver and it costs nothing.</p>

<p>RiNo has 200+ murals across warehouses and alleyways. Unlike museum art that sits there for decades, this stuff changes monthly. Artists literally paint over each other's work.</p>

<p>The CRUSH Walls alley between 29th and 30th on Larimer has about 40 murals in one stretch. There's a hidden alley between 27th and 28th that most tourists miss.</p>

<p>First Fridays are the move - galleries open late, live music, food trucks. Free block party with an art theme.</p>

<h2>Meow Wolf ($45)</h2>

<p>Four floors of interactive art connected by some loose storyline about interdimensional travel. You walk through it, touch everything, crawl through things, question reality.</p>

<p>There's a working pizza ATM on Level 3. Four hidden speakeasy bars. The entrance alone takes 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Worth it if you want something completely different. Skip if you're claustrophobic, hate strobe lights, or need things to make sense.</p>

<p>Go Tuesday-Thursday morning to avoid crowds. Wear comfortable shoes - you'll walk 2+ miles inside.</p>

<h2>Clyfford Still Museum ($15)</h2>

<p>The opposite of Meow Wolf. Quiet, contemplative, nine galleries of massive abstract paintings.</p>

<p>Clyfford Still controlled 95% of everything he created and chose Denver for his museum. These paintings don't exist anywhere else. You're seeing something exclusive just by walking in.</p>

<p>Great if you're into abstract art or just need a peaceful space. Skip if you need paintings explained or only like realistic art.</p>

<h2>Museum of Contemporary Art ($14)</h2>

<p>Honestly? Probably not worth it.</p>

<p>It's $14 for maybe 3-4 small galleries of often confusing installations. Sometimes interesting, usually not.</p>

<p>The rooftop cafe has great views though - you can access it without paying admission. Or just go to RedLine Contemporary Art Center instead. It's free and actually wants you to understand what you're looking at.</p>

<h2>Colorado Symphony ($15-95)</h2>

<p>Boettcher Hall is America's only in-the-round symphony hall. No matter where you sit, you're within 65 feet of the stage. You see musicians' faces, not their backs.</p>

<p>Best deals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Happy hour concerts on Friday afternoons: $15</li>
<li>Student tickets with ID: $10</li>
<li>Behind-orchestra seats: $15-30 and you're right there</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, they have a "Classically Cannabis" series where getting high is part of the experience. Denver is weird like that.</p>

<h2>Denver Museum of Nature & Science ($23)</h2>

<p>The dinosaur exhibits are legitimately good. Real Egyptian mummies too, plus a Mars meteorite you can touch.</p>

<p>Go after 4 PM for $10 tickets. You get 90 minutes, which is enough for the highlights. Park free in City Park and walk 5 minutes.</p>

<p>IMAX and planetarium add-ons ($8-10 each) usually aren't worth it unless something exceptional is playing.</p>

<h2>History Colorado Center ($18)</h2>

<p>Designed for kids. Interactive exhibits everywhere, ski jump simulator, time machine thing.</p>

<p>If you're an adult without kids, you'll feel like you're on a field trip you didn't sign up for. Try the Molly Brown House instead - actual historic home with better stories.</p>

<h2>Hidden Gems</h2>

<p><strong>Kirkland Museum ($15)</strong> feels like walking through an eccentric millionaire's house. Colorado art, international design, decorative arts arranged chaotically. No kids under 13 allowed, so it stays quiet.</p>

<p><strong>National Ballpark Museum (free)</strong> sits across from Coors Field. Exhibits from all 30 MLB stadiums, historic artifacts, rooftop with stadium views.</p>

<p><strong>RedLine Contemporary (free)</strong> hosts artist talks, changes exhibitions every 10 weeks, and actually explains the art. What MCA should be.</p>

<h2>Denver Botanic Gardens ($18)</h2>

<p>Feels pricey until you see it in May or June when everything's blooming. The Japanese Garden is one of the most authentic outside Japan.</p>

<p>Free alternatives: Washington Park gardens, Hudson Gardens in Littleton (30 acres). Botanic Gardens also has 6-8 free days per year for Colorado residents.</p>

<h2>Free Culture Day</h2>

<p>You can do a full day for zero dollars:</p>
<ul>
<li>Morning: Colorado State Capitol tour (free)</li>
<li>Late morning: RedLine Contemporary (free)</li>
<li>Afternoon: RiNo murals + Denver Central Market</li>
<li>Late afternoon: National Ballpark Museum (free)</li>
<li>Evening: Tattered Cover at Union Station</li>
</ul>

<p>Thursday nights in summer, catch a free performance at DPAC Galleria.</p>

<h2>What Makes Denver Different</h2>

<p>Denver's art scene doesn't take itself too seriously. It's cowboys and cannabis, symphony halls and street art, world-class museums next to warehouses full of weird immersive stuff.</p>

<p>Skip what you could see in any city. Focus on RiNo alleys, Red Rocks concerts, the things that are uniquely Mile High. That's when Denver becomes memorable.</p>
