                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> 18300 W Alameda Pkwy, Morrison, CO (20 miles from downtown Denver). <strong>Capacity:</strong> 9,525 seats. <strong>Elevation:</strong> 6,450 feet. Free to visit during the day when no events are scheduled.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Red Rocks isn't just a concert venue. It's a geological wonder, a fitness destination, and one of the most iconic landmarks in Colorado. If you're visiting Denver and skip Red Rocks, you're missing something special.</p>

                    <p>The amphitheatre sits between two massive red sandstone formations that are 300 feet tall and millions of years old. The acoustics are naturally perfect. The views of Denver in the distance are stunning. And on a clear night with the stars overhead, there's simply no concert experience like it anywhere in the world.</p>

                    <h2 id="concerts">Seeing a Concert at Red Rocks</h2>

                    <p>This is what Red Rocks is famous for. The Beatles played here. U2 recorded their iconic "Under a Blood Red Sky" album here. Every major artist considers Red Rocks a bucket-list venue.</p>

                    <p>The concert season runs from April through October. You'll find everything from massive headliners to intimate acoustic shows, EDM festivals to classical performances. Tickets sell out fast for popular acts, so if you see something you want, don't wait.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best seats:</strong> Rows 20-40 offer the sweet spot between being close to the stage and taking in the full amphitheatre experience. Too close and you miss the rock formations towering above. Too far back and you're watching the screens more than the stage.</p>

                    <p><strong>What to bring:</strong> Layers are essential - it can drop 20 degrees once the sun sets. A blanket or cushion makes the stone benches more comfortable. You can bring sealed water bottles and some food, but check the specific show's policy.</p>

                    <p><strong>Getting there:</strong> Leave earlier than you think. Traffic on I-70 and the access roads can add 45 minutes to your drive on busy nights. Consider <a href="/uber-vs-lyft-in-denver-comparing-prices-wait-times-and-features/">rideshare</a>, but know that pickup after shows is chaotic.</p>

                    <h2 id="hiking">Hiking and Fitness at Red Rocks</h2>

                    <p>When there's no event scheduled, Red Rocks transforms into one of Denver's best free outdoor gyms. The park opens at 5am and closes at 11pm, giving you plenty of time to explore.</p>

                    <p>The most popular workout is running the stairs. There are 380 steps from the bottom to the top of the amphitheatre, and locals treat this like their personal StairMaster. You'll see everyone from first-timers gasping for air to elite athletes doing multiple laps. Start slow - the altitude is no joke if you're not acclimated.</p>

                    <p>Beyond the stairs, the Trading Post Trail is a 1.4-mile loop that winds through the park with gorgeous views of the rock formations. It's an easy hike suitable for all fitness levels. For something more challenging, connect to the longer trail system that runs through the surrounding foothills.</p>

                    <h2 id="visiting">Visiting Red Rocks (Non-Concert Days)</h2>

                    <p>Even without a concert, Red Rocks is worth the 30-minute drive from Denver. The Visitor Center has exhibits on the venue's history, geology, and the legendary performers who've graced the stage. The Colorado Music Hall of Fame is here too.</p>

                    <p>Walk down to the stage and stand where your favorite artists have stood. Take photos with the iconic Red Rocks backdrop. Watch the sunset paint the rocks in shades of orange and red. It's free, it's beautiful, and it takes about an hour to explore everything.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Early morning for fitness and fewer crowds. Late afternoon for the best photography light. Avoid midday in summer when it's brutally hot with no shade.</p>

                    <h2 id="food">Food and Drinks</h2>

                    <p>Ship Rock Grille is the on-site restaurant with surprisingly good food and craft beers on tap. It's open on non-event days and offers a great patio with views. During concerts, food vendors throughout the venue serve the usual stadium fare.</p>

                    <p>The town of Morrison at the base of the hill has a few restaurants and bars worth checking out before or after a show. The Morrison Inn is a classic Colorado dive bar that's been serving concert-goers for decades.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Insider Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Altitude matters.</strong> At 6,450 feet, you'll feel the thin air. Drink water, take breaks on the stairs, and don't overdo it if you just arrived from sea level.</p>

                    <p><strong>Parking fills up fast.</strong> On concert nights, arrive at least 90 minutes before showtime for the best parking. The lower lots mean a shorter walk but a longer wait to exit.</p>

                    <p><strong>Check the weather.</strong> Afternoon thunderstorms are common in summer. Shows rarely cancel for weather, but sitting through a downpour isn't fun. Bring a poncho.</p>

                    <p><strong>Film in the Rocks.</strong> The venue hosts outdoor movie screenings during summer. Watching a classic film under the stars at Red Rocks is a uniquely Colorado experience.</p>

                    <p><strong>Yoga on the Rocks.</strong> Summer morning yoga sessions fill the amphitheatre with hundreds of people doing sun salutations as the sun rises. It sells out fast.</p>
