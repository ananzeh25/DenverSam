                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Main drag:</strong> Main Avenue from 5th to 13th Street. <strong>Vibe:</strong> Historic Western charm meets college town energy. <strong>Highlights:</strong> Breweries, local shops, the train depot. <strong>Walkable:</strong> Yes—park once and explore on foot.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Downtown Durango feels like a real place. Main Avenue is lined with late-1800s buildings that now house independent shops, craft breweries, and restaurants. Fort Lewis College brings youth and energy. The <a href="/durango/narrow-gauge-railroad/">narrow gauge railroad</a> depot anchors the south end, sending steam whistles echoing through town.</p>

                    <p>This isn't a resort town—it's a working community that happens to be surrounded by incredible outdoor recreation. Durango has maintained its character while embracing visitors, creating an authentic Colorado mountain town experience.</p>

                    <h2 id="main-avenue">Main Avenue</h2>

                    <p>The heart of downtown runs roughly from 5th Street (near the train depot) to 13th Street. Historic brick buildings house everything from outdoor gear shops to art galleries to the local hardware store. It's a mix of tourist-oriented businesses and everyday local spots.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best blocks:</strong> 6th to 9th Street is the densest concentration of restaurants, bars, and shops. The train depot area (5th Street) has historical significance. College Drive brings student energy.</p>

                    <h2 id="breweries">Craft Breweries</h2>

                    <p>Durango punches above its weight in craft beer. Several breweries are within walking distance downtown.</p>

                    <p><strong>Steamworks Brewing:</strong> The flagship Durango brewery. Large space, extensive food menu, and consistently good beers. A local institution since 1996.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ska Brewing:</strong> Known for canned craft beer before it was cool. The brewpub location has a lively atmosphere and food trucks.</p>

                    <p><strong>Carver Brewing:</strong> Breakfast and beer—yes, really. Great morning spot that becomes a brewpub later. Local favorite.</p>

                    <p><strong>Animas Brewing:</strong> Newer addition with a focus on quality over quantity. Smaller, more intimate space.</p>

                    <h2 id="shopping">Shopping</h2>

                    <p><strong>Outdoor gear:</strong> Multiple shops cater to mountain bikers, hikers, and skiers. Pine Needle Mountaineering is the longtime local favorite for climbing and backcountry gear.</p>

                    <p><strong>Books:</strong> Maria's Bookshop is an excellent independent bookstore with local titles and helpful staff.</p>

                    <p><strong>Art:</strong> Galleries along Main Avenue feature Southwestern art, photography, and local crafts. Sorrel Sky Gallery and Toh-Atin Gallery are standouts.</p>

                    <h2 id="train-depot">Train Depot</h2>

                    <p>The Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad depot at 5th and Main is worth visiting even if you're not taking the train. Watch the steam locomotives prepare for departure, explore the museum, and photograph the historic yard. <a href="/durango/narrow-gauge-railroad/">Full train guide here.</a></p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Park and walk.</strong> Street parking is available but can fill during peak times. Find a spot and explore on foot—everything is walkable.</p>

                    <p><strong>Evenings are lively.</strong> College students and visitors fill the breweries and restaurants. Main Avenue has good energy after dark.</p>

                    <p><strong>Connect to the river.</strong> The Animas River Trail runs parallel to downtown. Easy to pop down to the river for a quick break from shopping.</p>

                    <p><strong>Check for events.</strong> Summer brings outdoor concerts, farmers markets, and festivals. Durango's event calendar is active.</p>
