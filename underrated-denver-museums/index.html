<p>Here's something funny about living in Denver - everyone knows about the Denver Art Museum and Museum of Nature & Science.</p>

<p>But there are these other museums that locals just... ignore. Maybe because we think they're "too touristy" or we just forget they exist.</p>

<p>I started checking them out when friends visited. And honestly? Some of them are actually incredible.</p>

<h2 >Kirkland Museum of Fine & Decorative Art</h2>

<figure class="article-image"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1577720643272-265f09367456" alt="Decorative art museum display"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Kirkland is overwhelming in the best way possible</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Why locals skip it:</strong> Right next to the DAM, so it gets overshadowed</p>

<p><strong>Why you shouldn't:</strong> It's absolutely bonkers inside</p>

<p>This place is like your eccentric aunt's house if she was a millionaire art collector. There's SO MUCH STUFF. Chairs hanging from walls, entire room setups from different decades, random ceramics everywhere.</p>

<p>It's organized chaos. You'll see a Bauhaus chair next to a 1970s lamp next to medieval pottery. Somehow it works.</p>

<p>Takes about 90 minutes to see everything. No kids under 13 allowed, which honestly makes sense - you'd destroy everything.</p>

<h2 >History Colorado Center</h2>

<p><strong>Why locals skip it:</strong> Sounds boring, like a school field trip</p>

<p><strong>Why you shouldn't:</strong> It's actually super interactive</p>

<p>I avoided this place for YEARS thinking it was just dusty Colorado history. Wrong.</p>

<p>They have this ski jump simulator. A time machine thing where you "travel" to different eras of Denver. You can "mine" for silver. It's way more hands-on than expected.</p>

<p>The Denver diorama showing how the city grew is fascinating. You can see your neighborhood being built over time.</p>

<h2 >Museo de las Americas</h2>

<figure class="article-image"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1582139329536-e7284fece509" alt="Latin American art museum gallery"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Museo celebrates art you won't see anywhere else in Denver</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Why locals skip it:</strong> It's in the Santa Fe Art District, off the beaten path</p>

<p><strong>Why you shouldn't:</strong> Incredible Latin American art you won't see anywhere else</p>

<p>This museum is small but mighty. Ancient artifacts next to contemporary pieces. The Day of the Dead exhibition they do is incredible.</p>

<p>It's in an old school building, which adds to the vibe. Plus you're in Santa Fe district, so hit up <a href="https://denversam.com/rino-hidden-spots">First Friday art walks</a> after.</p>

<h2 >Clyfford Still Museum</h2>

<p><strong>Why locals skip it:</strong> "It's just one artist, how interesting can it be?"</p>

<p><strong>Why you shouldn't:</strong> The scale of his work is mind-blowing</p>

<p>Okay, abstract art isn't for everyone. But these paintings are HUGE. Like, entire-wall huge. The colors are insane.</p>

<p>The museum owns 95% of his life's work. You're seeing stuff that literally doesn't exist anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>There's also a room where you can paint your own abstract art. I'm terrible at art but it was weirdly therapeutic.</p>

<h2 >Black American West Museum</h2>

<p><strong>Why locals skip it:</strong> Small, in Five Points, not well advertised</p>

<p><strong>Why you shouldn't:</strong> Eye-opening history you didn't learn in school</p>

<p>Did you know 1 in 4 cowboys was Black? I didn't.</p>

<p>This museum is in the former home of Colorado's first Black woman doctor. It's small but packed with stories about Black pioneers, cowboys, and settlers.</p>

<p>The personal stories are what get you. Real letters, photographs, belongings. It reframes the whole "Wild West" narrative.</p>

<h2 >Molly Brown House Museum</h2>

<figure class="article-image"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583037189850-1921ae7c6c22" alt="Victorian house museum exterior"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Molly Brown House is a Victorian time capsule</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Why locals skip it:</strong> Seems like a tourist trap</p>

<p><strong>Why you shouldn't:</strong> The house is genuinely fascinating</p>

<p>Yes, the Titanic connection is cool. But the house itself is wild. Completely restored Victorian mansion with all original features.</p>

<p>The guided tour is actually good - they tell you about Denver society in the 1900s, not just Molly Brown. The stories about parties thrown here are insane.</p>

<p>October they do ghost tours. Haven't done it yet but heard it's legit creepy.</p>

<h2 >Forney Museum of Transportation</h2>

<p><strong>Why locals skip it:</strong> "Transportation museum" sounds boring</p>

<p><strong>Why you shouldn't:</strong> It's full of weird vehicles you've never seen</p>

<p>This place has Amelia Earhart's car. A bunch of old trains. Vintage motorcycles. Even old bicycles that look like death traps.</p>

<p>It's in this huge warehouse. Kids love it because they can get close to everything. Adults love it because... honestly, old cars are cool.</p>

<h2 >Morrison Natural History Museum</h2>

<p><strong>Why locals skip it:</strong> Everyone goes to the big Museum of Nature & Science instead</p>

<p><strong>Why you shouldn't:</strong> They have actual baby dinosaur fossils</p>

<p>This tiny museum in Morrison has real fossils discovered right in the area. The baby T-Rex tracks are incredible.</p>

<p>It's small - like an hour to see everything. But the volunteers are paleontologists who actually find this stuff. They'll talk your ear off if you let them (in a good way).</p>

<h2 >Wings Over the Rockies</h2>

<figure class="article-image"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1540962351504-03099e0a754b" alt="Aircraft museum hangar with vintage planes"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Wings Over the Rockies - basically a hangar full of cool planes</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Why locals skip it:</strong> It's in a weird location in Lowry</p>

<p><strong>Why you shouldn't:</strong> You can climb into actual fighter jets</p>

<p>This museum is in an old Air Force hangar. Full of military planes, space stuff, even a Star Wars X-Wing.</p>

<p>They let you climb into some of the cockpits. The B-52 bomber is absolutely massive. Way bigger than you'd expect.</p>

<h2 >The Money Museum</h2>

<p><strong>Why locals skip it:</strong> It's at the Federal Reserve, sounds boring</p>

<p><strong>Why you shouldn't:</strong> You can hold a gold bar worth $700,000</p>

<p>Free admission. You see how money is made, destroyed, processed. They have a bag with $1 million in shredded bills.</p>

<p>The gold bar thing is wild. It's behind glass but you can stick your hand in and try to lift it. It's impossibly heavy.</p>

<h2 >When to Actually Visit</h2>

<p><strong>Free days:</strong> Check SCFD free days - most museums have them monthly</p>

<p><strong>Best time:</strong> Weekday mornings. Empty museums are the best museums</p>

<p><strong>Rainy days:</strong> Perfect museum weather. Everyone else has the same idea though</p>

<p><strong>First Fridays:</strong> Some stay open late with special events</p>

<h2 >The Real Talk</h2>

<p>I think locals avoid these because we're museum snobs. We've been to MoMA or the Smithsonian and think Denver's smaller museums don't compare.</p>

<p>But that's the wrong way to look at it. These museums are specific to Denver and Colorado. You can't see this stuff anywhere else.</p>

<p>Plus they're never crowded. <a href="https://denversam.com/denver-museum-free-days">Unlike DAM on free days</a>, which is a zoo.</p>
