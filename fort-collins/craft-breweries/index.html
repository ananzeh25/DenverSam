                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Nickname:</strong> The Napa Valley of Beer. <strong>Count:</strong> 20+ craft breweries. <strong>Famous names:</strong> New Belgium, Odell, Horse & Dragon. <strong>Best approach:</strong> Old Town walkable loop or brewery bike tours.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Fort Collins earned its reputation as one of America's premier beer cities through decades of brewing excellence. Before craft beer was mainstream, New Belgium and Odell were pioneering styles and building a culture that now includes over 20 breweries in a city of 170,000 people. The concentration of quality breweries per capita rivals any city in the country.</p>

                    <p>What makes Fort Collins special isn't just quantity—it's the range. From the massive New Belgium facility to neighborhood nanobreweries, from traditional German lagers to experimental sours, you'll find every style and every scale represented. The brewing community is collaborative rather than competitive, and that spirit extends to visitors.</p>

                    <h2 id="major">Major Breweries</h2>

                    <p><strong>New Belgium Brewing</strong> is the flagship—a nationally distributed brewery that still feels connected to its Fort Collins roots. The Liquid Center taproom offers their full lineup including limited releases not available elsewhere. Free tours run daily but book up quickly, especially in summer. The campus along the Poudre River is worth visiting even without a tour.</p>

                    <p><strong>Odell Brewing Company</strong> is equally established and beloved. Their taproom features a massive outdoor patio that's packed on sunny days. The 90 Shilling amber is their classic, but the rotating pilot batches from their small-batch system are why locals keep returning. Tours available; the patio doesn't require one.</p>

                    <p><strong>Horse & Dragon Brewing</strong> represents the next generation—a mid-size operation that's earned national recognition for traditional styles. Their Sad Panda Coffee Stout has developed a devoted following. The industrial-area taproom has a welcoming, unpretentious atmosphere.</p>

                    <h2 id="neighborhood">Neighborhood Breweries</h2>

                    <p><strong>Funkwerks</strong> specializes in saisons and Belgian-influenced ales, winning medals at the Great American Beer Festival. Small taproom, focused selection, serious quality. Worth seeking out if Belgian styles are your preference.</p>

                    <p><strong>Jessup Farm Barrel House</strong> operates from a historic property on the north end of town. The setting—converted agricultural buildings—adds atmosphere to their barrel-aged and farmhouse offerings.</p>

                    <p><strong>Snowbank Brewing</strong> caters to an active crowd, with location near trails and mountain bike routes. Good selection of approachable styles for post-recreation refreshment.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rally King Brewing</strong> focuses on lagers done right—clean, crisp, and refreshing. A nice counterpoint to the hop-heavy options found elsewhere.</p>

                    <h2 id="tours">Brewery Tours</h2>

                    <p><strong>Self-guided walking</strong> works well in Old Town, where several breweries cluster within walking distance. Start at Coopersmith's (Fort Collins' first brewpub) and work your way through the options. The density makes this manageable even on foot.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bike brewery tours</strong> are popular given Fort Collins' excellent bike infrastructure. Several companies offer guided tours that hit multiple breweries with transportation handled. The Poudre River Trail connects New Belgium to downtown.</p>

                    <p><strong>Formal tours</strong> at New Belgium and Odell provide behind-the-scenes looks at large-scale production. New Belgium's tour includes their legendary spiral slide from the packaging hall. Reservations recommended.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Visiting Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Start early if bar-hopping.</strong> Brewery taprooms typically open around noon or 2 PM, closing relatively early. Plan your progression to hit more locations before evening closures.</p>

                    <p><strong>Flight your way through.</strong> Most taprooms offer flight options—four or five samples that let you try the range without committing to full pours. A few flights across multiple breweries gives you the true Fort Collins experience.</p>

                    <p><strong>Eat along the way.</strong> Some breweries have food, others don't. Old Town's restaurant options fill the gaps nicely. Don't try to hit every brewery on an empty stomach.</p>

                    <p><strong>Designated drivers matter.</strong> The brewery density makes it tempting to walk between locations, but verify distances—some are farther than they appear on maps. Rideshare services operate throughout Fort Collins.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Which brewery should I visit if I only have time for one?</h4>
                            <p>New Belgium for the full experience (tour, campus, river views) or Odell for the patio scene and reliable beer selection. Both are excellent choices for a single-brewery visit.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Are kids allowed at breweries?</h4>
                            <p>Policies vary. Many taprooms are family-friendly during daytime hours—check individual brewery websites. New Belgium and Odell both accommodate families.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>When is the best time to visit?</h4>
                            <p>Weekday afternoons are quieter. Weekend afternoons get crowded, especially on patios in good weather. Summer is peak season; fall offers nice weather with smaller crowds.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I buy beer to take home?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, most taprooms sell cans, bottles, or growlers to go. Some limited releases are taproom-only. Colorado allows beer sales at breweries for off-premise consumption.</p>
