                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>What:</strong> Historic downtown district with preserved Victorian architecture. <strong>Famous fact:</strong> Inspiration for Disneyland's Main Street USA. <strong>Highlights:</strong> Local shops, restaurants, breweries, live music. <strong>Best time:</strong> Evenings and weekends for atmosphere.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Old Town Fort Collins is the heart of the city—a walkable historic district where 19th-century buildings house modern shops, restaurants, and breweries. The preservation of Victorian-era architecture is so thorough that Walt Disney reportedly used it as inspiration for Main Street USA at Disneyland. Whether or not you see the resemblance, you'll find a genuinely charming downtown that feels both historic and alive.</p>

                    <p>Unlike some "historic districts" that feel like museums, Old Town is where Fort Collins actually lives. CSU students mix with families and visitors. Locals grab coffee at the same spots tourists discover. The energy comes from real use, not artificial preservation. This is the natural gathering place for a city that values walkability and community.</p>

                    <h2 id="layout">Layout & Getting Around</h2>

                    <p><strong>Main streets</strong> run in a grid pattern. College Avenue is the primary north-south artery, with Mountain Avenue crossing it as the main east-west street. Most shops and restaurants cluster within a few blocks of this intersection.</p>

                    <p><strong>Old Town Square</strong> is the central plaza, home to farmers markets, festivals, and community events. It's a natural starting point for exploration and a good meeting spot if your group splits up.</p>

                    <p><strong>Parking</strong> is available in several structures and street-side meters. The parking structures offer the first hour free—usually enough for a quick errand, not enough for a full visit. Street parking has time limits. For longer stays, the structures off Mountain Avenue work well.</p>

                    <p><strong>Walking</strong> is the best way to experience Old Town. The compact layout means everything is within a 10-minute walk. Bike parking is abundant if you're arriving on two wheels.</p>

                    <h2 id="dining">Dining</h2>

                    <p><strong>The variety</strong> spans from quick bites to fine dining. You'll find tacos, ramen, steaks, farm-to-table American, and everything in between. Fort Collins' food scene has matured significantly in recent years, and Old Town showcases the best of it.</p>

                    <p><strong>Coopersmith's Pub & Brewing</strong> holds historic significance as Fort Collins' first brewpub, opened in 1989 before the craft beer boom. The food is solid pub fare, and the beers are made on-site.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Rio Grande</strong> has been serving Mexican food since the 1980s, known for strong margaritas and a festive atmosphere. It's a Fort Collins institution.</p>

                    <p><strong>Reservations</strong> are recommended for dinner at popular restaurants, especially on weekends. Lunch is usually easier to find seating.</p>

                    <h2 id="shopping">Shopping</h2>

                    <p><strong>Local boutiques</strong> dominate, offering clothing, gifts, outdoor gear, and specialty items. Chain stores exist but don't overwhelm. The emphasis is on independent retailers who've chosen Fort Collins specifically.</p>

                    <p><strong>Trimble Court Artisans</strong> features work from local artists and craftspeople in a cooperative gallery setting. Good for unique gifts and Colorado-made items.</p>

                    <p><strong>The bookshops</strong> include both new and used options. Old Firehouse Books has been serving readers since 1985 in a converted fire station.</p>

                    <h2 id="breweries">Breweries & Nightlife</h2>

                    <p><strong>Several breweries</strong> operate within walking distance of Old Town Square. Coopersmith's is in the heart of it; others like Equinox and Deux Brewing are just blocks away. See our <a href="/fort-collins/craft-breweries/">craft brewery guide</a> for the full picture.</p>

                    <p><strong>Live music venues</strong> include the Aggie Theatre (a converted movie house) and Washington's, both hosting touring acts and local bands. The Armory is a larger venue for bigger shows.</p>

                    <p><strong>The scene</strong> stays active late on weekends, with college-age crowds mixing with older visitors. Weeknights are mellower but still have options for those seeking them.</p>

                    <h2 id="events">Events & Festivals</h2>

                    <p><strong>Farmers Market</strong> runs Saturday mornings from spring through fall in the square. Local produce, baked goods, and crafts draw crowds weekly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bohemian Nights at NewWestFest</strong> is the big summer festival—free music, street fair atmosphere, and packed crowds over a weekend in August.</p>

                    <p><strong>Holiday events</strong> include tree lighting, carolers, and festive decorations through December. Old Town does the holiday season well.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is Old Town really the inspiration for Disneyland's Main Street?</h4>
                            <p>This is often stated locally, though Disney Imagineers drew from multiple sources. The architectural similarity is real, and Fort Collins does appear on lists of towns that influenced the design.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is Old Town safe at night?</h4>
                            <p>Generally yes. It's well-lit and well-trafficked, especially on weekends. Standard urban awareness applies—stick to lit areas and main streets.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">

                            <p>A few hours for shopping and a meal, half a day if you want to explore thoroughly with brewery stops. It's worth multiple visits if you're staying in Fort Collins for several days.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
