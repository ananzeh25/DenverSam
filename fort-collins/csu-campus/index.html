                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Founded:</strong> 1870 as an agricultural college. <strong>Students:</strong> ~34,000. <strong>Colors:</strong> Green and gold. <strong>Highlights:</strong> The Oval, Canvas Stadium, Annual Flower Trial Garden. <strong>Known for:</strong> Veterinary medicine, atmospheric science, engineering.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Colorado State University is woven into the fabric of Fort Collins—literally. The university and the city grew up together, and CSU's presence shapes everything from the economy to the culture to the crowds in Old Town on game days. For visitors, the campus offers green spaces, architecture worth seeing, and a sense of the energy that 34,000 students bring to a city of 170,000.</p>

                    <p>Originally founded as Colorado Agricultural College, CSU has grown into a major research university while maintaining strong programs in its traditional strengths. The campus reflects this evolution—historic buildings mix with modern research facilities, and the agricultural roots remain visible in the extensive gardens and animal sciences facilities.</p>

                    <h2 id="oval">The Oval</h2>

                    <p><strong>The Oval</strong> is the heart of campus—a large green space surrounded by historic buildings, including the Administration Building with its distinctive architecture. Students cross it constantly; visitors use it as a gathering point and photo opportunity.</p>

                    <p><strong>The elms</strong> that lined the Oval were lost to Dutch elm disease, but replacement trees have matured to restore the shaded character. On pleasant days, the grass fills with students studying, playing frisbee, or just enjoying the outdoors.</p>

                    <p><strong>Buildings around the Oval</strong> include some of the oldest on campus. The Administration Building (Spruce Hall) dates to 1879. Walking the perimeter gives you a sense of campus history before exploring the newer areas.</p>

                    <h2 id="gardens">Gardens & Green Spaces</h2>

                    <p><strong>Annual Flower Trial Garden</strong> is a legitimate attraction, not just for garden enthusiasts. Located near the Center for the Arts, the gardens display thousands of flowers tested for performance in Colorado's climate. Peak bloom is July through September.</p>

                    <p><strong>W.D. Holley Plant Environmental Research Center</strong> houses the university's horticulture research, including a butterfly house and tropical conservatory. Open to visitors during scheduled hours.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Arboretum</strong> encompasses the entire main campus—CSU maintains an extensive tree collection with specimens labeled throughout. A self-guided tree tour is available online.</p>

                    <h2 id="stadium">Canvas Stadium</h2>

                    <p><strong>Canvas Stadium</strong> (opened 2017) is the home of CSU Rams football. The modern facility replaced the historic Hughes Stadium, bringing game days back to campus rather than the south edge of town. The stadium includes views of the mountains from the upper decks.</p>

                    <p><strong>Game days</strong> transform the area around the stadium and spill into Old Town. Green-clad fans fill the restaurants and breweries before and after games. The atmosphere is genuinely festive.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tours</strong> of the stadium are available for those interested in seeing the facilities outside of game days. Check with the athletic department for schedules.</p>

                    <h2 id="museums">Museums & Galleries</h2>

                    <p><strong>Gregory Allicar Museum of Art</strong> houses a significant collection of works on paper, plus rotating exhibitions. Free admission. Located in the University Center for the Arts.</p>

                    <p><strong>Avenir Museum of Design and Merchandising</strong> focuses on textiles, costumes, and design history. Small but specialized collection with rotating exhibitions.</p>

                    <h2 id="visiting">Visiting Campus</h2>

                    <p><strong>Parking</strong> is available in visitor lots and paid structures. Regulations are enforced during academic hours. Check current rates and restrictions, which vary by location.</p>

                    <p><strong>Walking the campus</strong> takes 1-2 hours if you're covering the main areas. The Oval, gardens, and central campus are the highlights. The campus is flat and accessible.</p>

                    <p><strong>Campus tours</strong> for prospective students are offered through the admissions office. General visitors can explore on their own or use the self-guided tour materials available online.</p>

                    <p><strong>Food on campus</strong> includes several dining locations and the Lory Student Center food court. Options are designed for students, so don't expect fine dining, but convenient if you're exploring during meal times.</p>
