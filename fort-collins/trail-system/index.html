                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Miles:</strong> 50+ miles of paved recreational trails. <strong>Major trails:</strong> Poudre River Trail, Spring Creek Trail, Power Trail. <strong>Uses:</strong> Biking, walking, running, rollerblading. <strong>Connection:</strong> Trails link neighborhoods, parks, Old Town, CSU, and New Belgium.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Fort Collins' trail system is one of the city's defining features—a network of paved multi-use paths that makes car-free transportation genuinely practical. Locals bike to work, to breweries, to dinner, using trails that connect residential areas to commercial centers. For visitors, the trails offer easy exploration of the city and access to natural areas without needing to drive.</p>

                    <p>The system has grown over decades, with new connections added regularly. The major trails follow waterways—the Poudre River Trail and Spring Creek Trail—while the Power Trail provides a north-south spine running the length of the city. Together they create a functional network rather than isolated recreation paths.</p>

                    <h2 id="poudre">Poudre River Trail</h2>

                    <p><strong>The signature trail</strong> follows the Cache la Poudre River through Fort Collins. The completed sections run from the Environmental Learning Center on the east side through downtown to Taft Hill Road on the west, with extensions continuing in both directions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Scenery varies</strong> from natural riparian areas with cottonwoods and willows to more urban sections through parks and past breweries. New Belgium Brewing sits directly on the trail—a popular rest stop for riders.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wildlife</strong> is surprisingly present along the river corridor. Great blue herons fish the shallows, deer browse the banks, and various songbirds occupy the riparian habitat. The natural feel persists even through developed areas.</p>

                    <p><strong>Connections</strong> to other trails are numerous. The Spring Creek Trail joins near Prospect Road. Spurs lead to Lee Martinez Park, Northside Aztlan Center, and numerous neighborhood access points.</p>

                    <h2 id="spring">Spring Creek Trail</h2>

                    <p><strong>The east-west connector</strong> runs from Poudre River through CSU campus and continues east to neighborhoods and natural areas. It's particularly useful for accessing the university area.</p>

                    <p><strong>CSU access</strong> makes this trail popular with students biking to campus. The trail passes through scenic stretches of the campus, including areas near the gardens.</p>

                    <p><strong>Spring Creek itself</strong> provides the corridor—a smaller waterway than the Poudre but with its own character. Wetland areas along the trail host bird life and native plants.</p>

                    <h2 id="power">Power Trail</h2>

                    <p><strong>The north-south spine</strong> runs roughly 20 miles from the Wyoming border south to Loveland, following a decommissioned rail corridor. It's the longest continuous trail in the system and links Fort Collins to neighboring communities.</p>

                    <p><strong>Relatively flat</strong> grade (it's a rail trail) makes this good for distance riding. The pavement is smooth and the path is wide. Road crossings are the main interruption.</p>

                    <p><strong>Commuter use</strong> is high—many residents use the Power Trail to bike between Fort Collins and Loveland or to access workplaces along the corridor.</p>

                    <h2 id="biking">Biking in Fort Collins</h2>

                    <p><strong>The bike culture</strong> is strong. Fort Collins has been designated a Platinum-level Bicycle Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists. Infrastructure includes not just trails but also bike lanes, sharrows, and bike parking throughout the city.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bike share</strong> is available for short trips and trail exploration. Stations are located throughout downtown and the CSU area.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rentals</strong> are available at several shops in town if you want your own bike for the day. Options range from cruisers for casual trail riding to road bikes for longer distances.</p>

                    <p><strong>Brewery connections</strong> are a particularly Fort Collins use case. You can bike to New Belgium and Odell directly on the Poudre Trail, then continue to other breweries via connecting routes. Designated drivers are less necessary when the bike trails lead directly to the tasting rooms.</p>

                    <h2 id="walking">Walking & Running</h2>

                    <p><strong>The trails are multi-use</strong>—walkers, runners, and cyclists share the paths. Standard etiquette applies: bikes yield to pedestrians, everyone passes on the left with warning.</p>

                    <p><strong>Popular running routes</strong> include loops using Spring Creek and Poudre River trails. The natural scenery makes training runs more pleasant than street running.</p>

                    <p><strong>Access points</strong> are frequent. Parks, trailheads, and neighborhood connections mean you're rarely far from the trail system wherever you are in the city.</p>

                    <h2 id="practical">Practical Information</h2>

                    <p><strong>Hours:</strong> Trails are open dawn to dusk. Lighting is present on some sections but not all—plan to finish before dark or carry lights.</p>

                    <p><strong>Parking:</strong> Parks along the trails offer parking. Spring Creek Park, Prospect Park, and Martinez Park are common starting points. Old Town also provides access to multiple trail connections.</p>

                    <p><strong>Maps:</strong> The city maintains detailed trail maps online. Apps like AllTrails and Strava also show the trail network with GPS routing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Winter use:</strong> Trails remain open but may have snow and ice. The city clears priority segments but not all sections. Fat bikes handle winter conditions; standard bikes may struggle.</p>
