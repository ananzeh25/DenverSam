                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Season:</strong> April through May. <strong>Weather:</strong> Highly variable—can range from 70°F to snowstorms in the same week. <strong>Highlights:</strong> Wildflowers, baby wildlife, low crowds, better prices. <strong>Challenges:</strong> Trail Ridge Road closed until late May, some high trails snow-covered.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Spring in Estes Park is the true shoulder season—a transitional period between winter's quiet and summer's crowds. The weather is unpredictable, swinging between warm sunny days and late-season snowstorms. Trail Ridge Road remains closed, and high-elevation trails may be impassable. But for flexible travelers, spring offers wildflowers, newborn wildlife, solitude, and prices lower than the busy months ahead.</p>

                    <p>April and May see the park awakening. Snow melts from lower elevations, streams run high with snowmelt, and the first wildflowers appear in meadows. Elk calves and other baby animals add wildlife viewing opportunities. The trade-off is uncertainty—spring requires accepting that conditions may not match your plans.</p>

                    <h2 id="weather">Spring Weather</h2>

                    <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> Spring temperatures are all over the map. April can see highs in the 50s-60s°F one day and snowstorms the next. May is generally warmer but still variable. Be prepared for anything from shorts weather to winter conditions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Snow:</strong> Late-season snowstorms are common through May. These are typically wet, heavy snows that melt quickly at lower elevations but add to snowpack above treeline. Higher trails remain snow-covered well into June.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wind:</strong> Spring is the windiest season. Strong gusts are common, especially on exposed ridges and along Trail Ridge Road (once it opens).</p>

                    <p><strong>Best approach:</strong> Check forecasts daily and be flexible. Have backup plans for indoor activities when weather doesn't cooperate. The sunny days between storms are genuinely beautiful.</p>

                    <h2 id="access">Access & Conditions</h2>

                    <p><strong>Trail Ridge Road:</strong> Closed until late May, typically around Memorial Day weekend. The exact opening depends on snowpack and plowing progress. Check the park website for current status as your visit approaches.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bear Lake area:</strong> Generally accessible, though the road may close temporarily during storms. Lower trails like Sprague Lake and the Bear Lake loop may be clear; higher trails like Emerald Lake may still have significant snow.</p>

                    <p><strong>Lower elevation trails:</strong> Trails below 9,000 feet typically clear earlier. Gem Lake, Cub Lake, and Moraine Park trails are often accessible when higher routes are not.</p>

                    <p><strong>Streams and waterfalls:</strong> Spring snowmelt means high water. Waterfalls like Alberta Falls are at their most dramatic. Stream crossings may be challenging or impassable on some trails.</p>

                    <h2 id="wildlife">Spring Wildlife</h2>

                    <p><strong>Elk calves</strong> are born in late May and early June. Cow elk with newborn calves are extremely protective—maintain extra distance (at least 75 yards) and never approach a calf, even if it appears abandoned.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bighorn sheep</strong> are particularly active at Sheep Lakes in spring, visiting mineral licks after winter. This is one of the best times for bighorn viewing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Moose</strong> are active in the Kawuneeche Valley and other willow habitat. Spring moose can be unpredictable—maintain distance.</p>

                    <p><strong>Birds</strong> return in spring. Watch for mountain bluebirds, hummingbirds (arriving late May), and raptors hunting the meadows.</p>

                    <h2 id="wildflowers">Wildflowers</h2>

                    <p><strong>Lower meadows</strong> see the first blooms in April—pasque flowers and early buttercups push through receding snow. As snow melts upward through May and June, the bloom follows.</p>

                    <p><strong>Peak timing</strong> varies by elevation and year. Lower meadows peak in late May; higher areas won't peak until July. Spring visitors see the beginning of the bloom, not its zenith.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wet conditions</strong> often accompany spring wildflowers. Waterproof boots help for off-trail exploration in muddy meadows.</p>

                    <h2 id="planning">Spring Planning</h2>

                    <p><strong>Flexible itineraries</strong> are essential. Don't plan rigidly around specific trails or activities—weather may force changes. Have multiple options ready.</p>

                    <p><strong>Lodging prices</strong> are lower than summer, and availability is better. Some seasonal businesses remain closed until Memorial Day, but core options operate year-round.</p>

                    <p><strong>Layered clothing</strong> is mandatory. You may need winter gear one day and shorts the next. Pack for the full range of conditions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Late May</strong> offers the best spring conditions: Trail Ridge Road typically opens, weather stabilizes somewhat, and summer crowds haven't yet arrived. If you can time a spring visit, aim for the last two weeks of May.</p>

                            <p>It can be, if you're flexible and don't mind weather uncertainty. Lower crowds and prices are appealing. But if you want guaranteed hiking conditions and Trail Ridge Road access, wait for summer.</p>
