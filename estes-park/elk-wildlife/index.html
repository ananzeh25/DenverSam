                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Best time:</strong> September-October for elk rut; year-round for general wildlife. <strong>Best locations:</strong> Moraine Park, Horseshoe Park, and downtown Estes Park during rut. <strong>Essential gear:</strong> Binoculars, telephoto lens, patience.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Wildlife viewing is one of Estes Park's signature experiences, and the elk are the main attraction. Rocky Mountain National Park and the surrounding area support large herds that visitors can observe from roadsides, meadows, and sometimes right in downtown Estes Park. During fall rut season, hundreds of elk gather in visible locations, with bull elk bugling and competing for harems in an ancient ritual that draws photographers and nature lovers from around the world.</p>

                    <p>Beyond elk, the region hosts bighorn sheep, mule deer, moose, black bears, mountain lions (rarely seen), coyotes, and smaller mammals from marmots to pikas. Bird watching is excellent, with opportunities to spot everything from Steller's jays to golden eagles.</p>

                    <h2 id="elk">Elk Viewing</h2>

                    <p><strong>Year-round locations:</strong> Elk can be spotted throughout the year in Rocky Mountain National Park's meadows. Moraine Park and Horseshoe Park are the most reliable spots, particularly at dawn and dusk when elk move from forests to graze in open areas.</p>

                    <p><strong>The rut (September-October):</strong> This is prime time. Bull elk have grown their antlers to full size and compete for breeding rights. The bugling calls—eerie, high-pitched sounds that carry for miles—are unlike anything else in nature. Large herds gather in visible locations, and the drama of bulls sparring and managing harems unfolds in real time.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rut locations:</strong> Moraine Park is the most famous viewing area, with large herds often visible from the road. Horseshoe Park offers similar opportunities. During rut, elk also wander into downtown Estes Park—it's not unusual to see them on golf courses, in parks, and grazing near restaurants.</p>

                    <p><strong>Timing:</strong> Early morning and evening are best. Elk are most active at dawn, bed down during midday, and become active again before dusk. The bugling is loudest in the hours around sunrise and sunset.</p>

                    <h2 id="other">Other Wildlife</h2>

                    <p><strong>Bighorn sheep</strong> are the park's other signature large mammal. Sheep Lakes in Horseshoe Park is named for them—the mineral licks here attract sheep, especially in spring and early summer. They're also seen on rocky slopes throughout the park.</p>

                    <p><strong>Moose</strong> prefer the wetter west side of the park, particularly the Kawuneeche Valley along Trail Ridge Road. They're also found along the Colorado River corridor and in willow thickets. Bull moose are most impressive in fall when their antlers are fully grown.</p>

                    <p><strong>Mule deer</strong> are common throughout the area, often seen along roadsides and in meadows. They're smaller than elk and have the distinctive large ears that give them their name.</p>

                    <p><strong>Black bears</strong> are present but shy. Sightings are uncommon and usually brief. Practice bear safety by storing food properly and keeping a clean campsite.</p>

                    <p><strong>Smaller mammals:</strong> Marmots are easy to spot in rocky areas, especially at higher elevations. Pikas (small, round relatives of rabbits) live in boulder fields and announce their presence with high-pitched calls. Chipmunks and golden-mantled ground squirrels are everywhere.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Viewing Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Keep your distance.</strong> Park regulations require staying at least 25 yards from elk and deer, 100 yards from moose, and further from bears. Use binoculars or telephoto lenses rather than approaching. Animals that become habituated to humans often have to be relocated or destroyed.</p>

                    <p><strong>Never feed wildlife.</strong> It's illegal, dangerous, and harmful to the animals. Fed animals lose their natural fear of humans and often become aggressive.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bring binoculars.</strong> Even inexpensive binoculars dramatically improve the wildlife viewing experience. You'll see details and behaviors that are invisible to the naked eye.</p>

                    <p><strong>Be patient.</strong> Wildlife viewing rewards those who wait quietly. Find a good location, get comfortable, and let the animals come to you rather than chasing them.</p>

                    <p><strong>Drive carefully.</strong> Animals frequently cross roads, especially at dawn and dusk. Elk-car collisions are common and dangerous for both parties. Slow down in wildlife areas.</p>

                    <h2 id="photography">Wildlife Photography</h2>

                    <p><strong>Telephoto lens</strong> is essential for wildlife photography. A 200-400mm lens on a full-frame camera, or equivalent zoom on smaller sensors, lets you fill the frame while maintaining safe distance.</p>

                    <p><strong>Golden hour light</strong> (early morning and late evening) produces the best images and coincides with peak wildlife activity. The warm, directional light adds dimension and drama to wildlife portraits.</p>

                    <p><strong>Patience and planning:</strong> Scout locations during midday when wildlife is less active, note where animals appear, and return during optimal light. The best wildlife photographers spend far more time waiting than shooting.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>When is elk rut season?</h4>
                            <p>Generally mid-September through mid-October, peaking in late September and early October. The timing varies slightly each year depending on weather and other factors.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I see elk year-round?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, elk are present year-round in Rocky Mountain National Park. Summer and winter viewing is possible in Moraine Park and other meadow areas, though animals are more dispersed than during rut.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Are elk dangerous?</h4>
                            <p>Yes. Elk are wild animals weighing 500-1,000 pounds with sharp hooves and (in bulls) large antlers. During rut, bulls are especially unpredictable. Cow elk protecting calves can be aggressive in spring. Always maintain required distances.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>What's the best way to find wildlife?</h4>
                            <p>Drive slowly through meadow areas at dawn and dusk. Look for cars stopped along roadsides—other visitors often spot animals first. Park rangers can provide tips on recent sightings at visitor centers.</p>
