                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Elevation:</strong> Reaches 12,183 feet—highest continuous paved road in the US. <strong>Length:</strong> 48 miles from Estes Park to Grand Lake. <strong>Season:</strong> Late May to mid-October, weather permitting. <strong>Drive time:</strong> 2-3 hours with stops.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Trail Ridge Road is Rocky Mountain National Park's signature experience for anyone who doesn't want to—or can't—hike to alpine elevations. The road climbs from montane forests through subalpine meadows and emerges above treeline into genuine arctic tundra, the same ecosystem found in northern Alaska and Siberia. Eleven miles of the road sit above 11,500 feet, with the highest point topping out at 12,183 feet.</p>

                    <p>This isn't just a drive; it's a journey through multiple life zones in under an hour. You'll pass from ponderosa pines to spruce-fir forests to wind-sculpted krummholz (stunted trees) to treeless tundra where tiny wildflowers bloom in July and August. Marmots whistle from rockpiles, ptarmigan blend into the landscape, and the views extend seemingly forever.</p>

                    <h2 id="route">The Route</h2>

                    <p><strong>East entrance (Estes Park side):</strong> Enter through Beaver Meadows or Fall River entrances. The climb begins gradually through forests, with Many Parks Curve offering the first major viewpoint. The road then ascends more steeply through the Rainbow Curve series of switchbacks.</p>

                    <p><strong>Above treeline:</strong> Near Forest Canyon Overlook, trees give way to tundra. The next several miles traverse the alpine zone, with multiple pull-offs at named viewpoints. Rock Cut provides short tundra walks. The Alpine Visitor Center at Fall River Pass marks roughly the halfway point and highest visitor center in the National Park System.</p>

                    <p><strong>West descent:</strong> From the Alpine Visitor Center, the road descends toward Grand Lake through the Kawuneeche Valley. This side sees fewer crowds and offers different scenery—the Colorado River headwaters, moose habitat, and views of the Never Summer Mountains.</p>

                    <h2 id="stops">Essential Stops</h2>

                    <p><strong>Many Parks Curve</strong> provides the first panoramic views of the park's peaks and the "parks" (mountain meadows) below. It's a good introduction to what's ahead and a chance to acclimate before going higher.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rainbow Curve</strong> offers views back toward Estes Park and the Continental Divide ahead. The interpretive signs explain the geology and ecosystem transitions visible from this elevation.</p>

                    <p><strong>Forest Canyon Overlook</strong> is the first above-treeline stop, with views into the U-shaped glacial valley of Forest Canyon. The short walk from the parking area to the overlook introduces you to tundra terrain.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rock Cut</strong> features the Tundra Communities Trail, a half-mile paved path through alpine tundra. Interpretive signs explain the fragile ecosystem and the plants that survive here. This is your best opportunity to walk in the tundra without venturing far from the road.</p>

                    <p><strong>Alpine Visitor Center</strong> sits at 11,796 feet and includes exhibits, a gift shop, and the Trail Ridge Store with food service. The Alpine Ridge Trail climbs from here to views in all directions—it's steep and short, but remember you're already at nearly 12,000 feet.</p>

                    <h2 id="wildlife">Wildlife</h2>

                    <p><strong>Marmots</strong> are the signature alpine animals, visible on rocky slopes near parking areas. They're photogenic and relatively tolerant of people, though feeding wildlife is prohibited.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pikas</strong> are harder to spot—small, round relatives of rabbits that live in rockpiles. Listen for their high-pitched "eek!" calls before you see them.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bighorn sheep</strong> sometimes appear on rocky slopes, particularly in spring when they seek mineral licks. The Sheep Lakes area on the east side is named for them.</p>

                    <p><strong>Elk</strong> graze in meadows along the lower portions of the road, especially in the Kawuneeche Valley on the west side and Moraine Park on the east.</p>

                    <h2 id="tips">Driving Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Start early.</strong> Afternoon thunderstorms are common above treeline from June through August. Lightning at 12,000 feet is serious business. Plan to be below treeline by early afternoon.</p>

                    <p><strong>Watch for altitude effects.</strong> Some people feel lightheaded or short of breath at these elevations. Take your time, stay hydrated, and don't overexert. The effects are temporary but real.</p>

                    <p><strong>Expect cool temperatures.</strong> Even when Estes Park is warm, Trail Ridge Road can be 20-30 degrees cooler with strong winds. Bring layers regardless of the forecast below.</p>

                    <p><strong>Allow plenty of time.</strong> The drive could be done in two hours without stopping, but why would you? Budget 3-4 hours minimum to appreciate the stops and viewpoints.</p>

                            <p>RVs are allowed, but the road has sharp curves and steep grades. Large vehicles should be comfortable with mountain driving. Trailers are not recommended and prohibited on Old Fall River Road.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is Trail Ridge Road scary to drive?</h4>
                            <p>The road is well-maintained and not particularly narrow, but it does have steep drop-offs without guardrails in some sections. Most drivers handle it fine, but those with severe fear of heights may find some sections uncomfortable.</p>
