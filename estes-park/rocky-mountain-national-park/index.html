                        <h2>Quick Info</h2>
                        <p><strong>Size:</strong> 415 square miles, 60+ peaks over 12,000 ft. <strong>Elevation:</strong> 7,860 to 14,259 ft. <strong>Entry fee:</strong> $30/vehicle (7-day pass). <strong>Timed entry:</strong> Required May-October. <strong>From Estes Park:</strong> 5 minutes to Beaver Meadows entrance.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Rocky Mountain National Park is the crown jewel of Colorado's outdoor destinations. Over 4 million visitors annually come to experience alpine tundra, pristine lakes, abundant wildlife, and 355 miles of hiking trails. Estes Park serves as the primary gateway, with three of the park's five entrances accessible from town.</p>

                    <p>The park spans the Continental Divide, offering dramatically different ecosystems on each side. The east side from Estes Park features glacial valleys, montane forests, and the famous Trail Ridge Road. Whether you're here for a day drive or a week of backcountry exploration, RMNP delivers wilderness experiences unlike anywhere else in the Lower 48.</p>

                    <h2 id="entrances">Entrances from Estes Park</h2>

                    <p><strong>Beaver Meadows Entrance</strong> is the main east-side entrance, just 5 minutes from downtown Estes Park on Highway 36. The visitor center here provides maps, ranger programs, and exhibits. This is where most first-time visitors enter and where Trail Ridge Road begins its ascent.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fall River Entrance</strong> on Highway 34 offers direct access to Old Fall River Road (one-way, unpaved) and connects to Trail Ridge Road. It's slightly less crowded than Beaver Meadows and closer to some popular trailheads.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wild Basin Entrance</strong> lies south of Estes Park near Allenspark. This quieter corner of the park features waterfalls, alpine lakes, and fewer crowds. Worth the extra drive for hikers seeking solitude.</p>

                    <h2 id="timed-entry">Timed Entry Reservations</h2>

                    <p><strong>Reservations are required</strong> from late May through mid-October. Two types exist: one for Bear Lake Road corridor (the most popular area), another for the rest of the park. Without a reservation, you'll be turned away during peak hours.</p>

                    <p><strong>Book early.</strong> Reservations release in batches on Recreation.gov. Summer dates sell out within minutes of release. Set reminders for release dates and be ready to book immediately.</p>

                    <p><strong>Alternatives exist.</strong> Enter before 5am or after 6pm (when reservations aren't required). Holders of camping, wilderness, or climbing permits don't need separate timed entry reservations.</p>

                    <p><strong>Check current rules.</strong> Policies change annually. Visit the official NPS website for current requirements before your trip. Rules differ between the Bear Lake corridor and general park access.</p>

                    <h2 id="trail-ridge">Trail Ridge Road</h2>

                    <p><strong>America's highest continuous paved road</strong> reaches 12,183 feet, crossing above treeline for 11 miles. The 48-mile route from Estes Park to Grand Lake takes 2-3 hours without stops—but you'll want stops.</p>

                    <p><strong>Alpine Visitor Center</strong> at Fall River Pass offers exhibits, a gift shop, and the Alpine Ridge Trail. At 11,796 feet, it's the highest visitor center in the National Park system. Arrive early—the parking lot fills by mid-morning in summer.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wildlife viewing</strong> along the road includes elk, marmots, pikas, and bighorn sheep. The alpine tundra sections offer the best chances for high-altitude species.</p>

                    <p><strong>Seasonal closure</strong> typically runs from mid-October through late May, depending on snow. Check current conditions before planning a Trail Ridge Road trip.</p>

                    <h2 id="wildlife">Wildlife</h2>

                    <p><strong>Elk are everywhere</strong> in and around the park. Fall rut season (September-October) brings spectacular bugling displays, especially at Moraine Park and Horseshoe Park. Keep 75 feet distance—rangers actively enforce this.</p>

                    <p><strong>Moose</strong> inhabit the west side and marshy areas. Colorado River headwaters and Kawuneeche Valley offer the best sightings. They're less common on the Estes Park side but occasionally seen near waterways.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bighorn sheep</strong> frequent the higher elevations and rocky outcrops. Sheep Lakes on Highway 34 is a reliable spot in spring and early summer when they come for mineral deposits.</p>

                    <p><strong>Black bears</strong> live throughout the park but are rarely seen. Proper food storage is required for all backcountry camping. Mountain lions exist but sightings are extremely rare.</p>

                    <h2 id="hiking">Popular Hikes</h2>

                    <p><strong>Bear Lake trailhead</strong> accesses several classic hikes: Emerald Lake (3.6 miles RT), Dream Lake (2.2 miles RT), and Nymph Lake (1.0 mile RT). These fill parking lots by 6am in summer—take the park shuttle or arrive at dawn.</p>

                    <p><strong>Alberta Falls</strong> (1.6 miles RT) is the most accessible waterfall hike. The trail starts at Glacier Gorge and follows a well-maintained path to a 30-foot cascade.</p>

                    <p><strong>Deer Mountain</strong> (6 miles RT) offers a moderate summit with 360-degree views. Less crowded than Bear Lake trails, with excellent fall colors.</p>

                    <p><strong>Longs Peak</strong> (14,259 feet) is Colorado's northernmost fourteener. The Keyhole Route is a strenuous 15-mile round trip requiring alpine starts and mountaineering skills. Not a beginner hike—many hikers underestimate it.</p>

                    <h2 id="seasons">Seasonal Guide</h2>

                    <p><strong>Summer (June-August):</strong> Peak season with wildflowers, full trail access, and crowded conditions. Afternoon thunderstorms are common above treeline—finish high-altitude hikes by noon.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fall (September-October):</strong> Elk rut, golden aspens, and fewer crowds. Trail Ridge Road typically closes mid-October. Arguably the best time to visit.</p>

                    <p><strong>Winter (November-April):</strong> Most roads closed, but excellent snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. Bear Lake Road stays plowed. Quietest season with dramatic scenery.</p>

                    <p><strong>Spring (May-early June):</strong> Transitional season with mud, snow at elevation, and unpredictable access. Waterfalls peak with snowmelt. Trail Ridge Road opening varies by year.</p>

                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Do I need a timed entry reservation?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, from late May through mid-October. Separate reservations for Bear Lake corridor and general park access. Book through Recreation.gov well in advance.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How long should I spend in the park?</h4>
                            <p>A half-day covers Trail Ridge Road drive with stops. A full day allows one or two hikes plus the drive. Serious hikers and wildlife watchers benefit from multiple days.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is Rocky Mountain National Park crowded?</h4>
                            <p>Very crowded in summer, especially at Bear Lake. Early mornings, weekdays, and shoulder seasons (September, early June) offer better experiences. Wild Basin and the west side see fewer visitors.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I see wildlife?</h4>
                            <p>Yes, elk are nearly guaranteed year-round. Dawn and dusk offer best sightings. Fall rut is spectacular. Moose, bighorn sheep, and marmots are common with patience.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Is altitude a concern?</h4>
                            <p>Yes. The park ranges from 7,860 to 14,259 feet. Drink water, take it slow, and descend if you experience severe headache or nausea. Arriving a day early to acclimate helps.</p>
